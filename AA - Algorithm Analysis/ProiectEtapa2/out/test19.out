The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 648156 nanoseconds (6.48156E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -15698 nanoseconds (-1.5698E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 663854 nanoseconds (6.63854E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 176294 nanoseconds (1.76294E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 487560 nanoseconds (4.8756E-4 seconds).
