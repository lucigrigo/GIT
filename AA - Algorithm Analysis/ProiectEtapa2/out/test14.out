The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 684430 nanoseconds (6.8443E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 153966 nanoseconds (1.53966E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 530464 nanoseconds (5.30464E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
