The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 23226 nanoseconds (2.3226E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -41502 nanoseconds (-4.1502E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 64728 nanoseconds (6.4728E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 35770 nanoseconds (3.577E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 28958 nanoseconds (2.8958E-5 seconds).
