The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 53194 nanoseconds (5.3194E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -53811 nanoseconds (-5.3811E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 107005 nanoseconds (1.07005E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
