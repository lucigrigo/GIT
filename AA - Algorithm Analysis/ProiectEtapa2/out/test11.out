The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 212371 nanoseconds (2.12371E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 18334 nanoseconds (1.8334E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 194037 nanoseconds (1.94037E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
