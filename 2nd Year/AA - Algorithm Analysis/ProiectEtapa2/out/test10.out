The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 43128 nanoseconds (4.3128E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -39949 nanoseconds (-3.9949E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 83077 nanoseconds (8.3077E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 11
	match 2 at index 45
	match 3 at index 79
	match 4 at index 113
	match 5 at index 144
	match 6 at index 178

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 27850 nanoseconds (2.785E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 11
	match 2 at index 45
	match 3 at index 79
	match 4 at index 113
	match 5 at index 144
	match 6 at index 178


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 55227 nanoseconds (5.5227E-5 seconds).
