The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 29451 nanoseconds (2.9451E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -37623 nanoseconds (-3.7623E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 67074 nanoseconds (6.7074E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (12) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 11
	match 3 at index 24
	match 4 at index 36
	match 5 at index 50

	match 12 at index 136

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 28489 nanoseconds (2.8489E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (12) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 11
	match 3 at index 24
	match 4 at index 36
