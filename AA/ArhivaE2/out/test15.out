The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 6767439 nanoseconds (0.006767439 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 5669546 nanoseconds (0.005669546 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 1097893 nanoseconds (0.001097893 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 15
