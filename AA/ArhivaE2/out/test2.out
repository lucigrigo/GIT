The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 10447 nanoseconds (1.0447E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -40913 nanoseconds (-4.0913E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 51360 nanoseconds (5.136E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 22

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 18145 nanoseconds (1.8145E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 22


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 33215 nanoseconds (3.3215E-5 seconds).
