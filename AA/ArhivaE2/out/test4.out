The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 24272 nanoseconds (2.4272E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -41298 nanoseconds (-4.1298E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 65570 nanoseconds (6.557E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 27499 nanoseconds (2.7499E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 38071 nanoseconds (3.8071E-5 seconds).
