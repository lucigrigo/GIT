The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 28700 nanoseconds (2.87E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -64225 nanoseconds (-6.4225E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 92925 nanoseconds (9.2925E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 21554 nanoseconds (2.1554E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 71371 nanoseconds (7.1371E-5 seconds).
