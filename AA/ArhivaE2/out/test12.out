The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 593552 nanoseconds (5.93552E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 174167 nanoseconds (1.74167E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 419385 nanoseconds (4.19385E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
