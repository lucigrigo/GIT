The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 12976611 nanoseconds (0.012976611 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 1939229 nanoseconds (0.001939229 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 11037382 nanoseconds (0.011037382 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 6161130 nanoseconds (0.00616113 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 4876252 nanoseconds (0.004876252 seconds).
