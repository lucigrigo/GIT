The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 13476677 nanoseconds (0.013476677 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 1625871 nanoseconds (0.001625871 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 11850806 nanoseconds (0.011850806 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 6973759 nanoseconds (0.006973759 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 4877047 nanoseconds (0.004877047 seconds).
