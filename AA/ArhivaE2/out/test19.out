The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 703371 nanoseconds (7.03371E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -162622 nanoseconds (-1.62622E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 865993 nanoseconds (8.65993E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 150054 nanoseconds (1.50054E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 715939 nanoseconds (7.15939E-4 seconds).
