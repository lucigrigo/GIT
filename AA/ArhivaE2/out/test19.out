The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 624955 nanoseconds (6.24955E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -129013 nanoseconds (-1.29013E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 753968 nanoseconds (7.53968E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 173829 nanoseconds (1.73829E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 580139 nanoseconds (5.80139E-4 seconds).
