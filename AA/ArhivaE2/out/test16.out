The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 734474 nanoseconds (7.34474E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -78549 nanoseconds (-7.8549E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 813023 nanoseconds (8.13023E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 161332 nanoseconds (1.61332E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 651691 nanoseconds (6.51691E-4 seconds).
