The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 644032 nanoseconds (6.44032E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -132335 nanoseconds (-1.32335E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 776367 nanoseconds (7.76367E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 157339 nanoseconds (1.57339E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 619028 nanoseconds (6.19028E-4 seconds).
