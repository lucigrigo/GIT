The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 6908 nanoseconds (6.908E-6 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -42274 nanoseconds (-4.2274E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 49182 nanoseconds (4.9182E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 8

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 24067 nanoseconds (2.4067E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 8


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 25115 nanoseconds (2.5115E-5 seconds).
