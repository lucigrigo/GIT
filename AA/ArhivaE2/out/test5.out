The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 28270 nanoseconds (2.827E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -25444 nanoseconds (-2.5444E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 53714 nanoseconds (5.3714E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 17604 nanoseconds (1.7604E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 36110 nanoseconds (3.611E-5 seconds).
