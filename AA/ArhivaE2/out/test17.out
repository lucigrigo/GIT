The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 958124 nanoseconds (9.58124E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 204109 nanoseconds (2.04109E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 754015 nanoseconds (7.54015E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 203954 nanoseconds (2.03954E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 550061 nanoseconds (5.50061E-4 seconds).
