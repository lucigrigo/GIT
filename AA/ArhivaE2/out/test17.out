The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 609729 nanoseconds (6.09729E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -42837 nanoseconds (-4.2837E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 652566 nanoseconds (6.52566E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 184420 nanoseconds (1.8442E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 468146 nanoseconds (4.68146E-4 seconds).
