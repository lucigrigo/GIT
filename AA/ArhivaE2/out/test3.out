The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 46610 nanoseconds (4.661E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -41296 nanoseconds (-4.1296E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 87906 nanoseconds (8.7906E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 25930 nanoseconds (2.593E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 61976 nanoseconds (6.1976E-5 seconds).
