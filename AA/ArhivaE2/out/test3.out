The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 47593 nanoseconds (4.7593E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -52703 nanoseconds (-5.2703E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 100296 nanoseconds (1.00296E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 29011 nanoseconds (2.9011E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 71285 nanoseconds (7.1285E-5 seconds).
