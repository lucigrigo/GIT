The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 984199 nanoseconds (9.84199E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -68608 nanoseconds (-6.8608E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 1052807 nanoseconds (0.001052807 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 216526 nanoseconds (2.16526E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 836281 nanoseconds (8.36281E-4 seconds).
