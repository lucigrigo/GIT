The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 913183 nanoseconds (9.13183E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -443405 nanoseconds (-4.43405E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 1356588 nanoseconds (0.001356588 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 196073 nanoseconds (1.96073E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 1160515 nanoseconds (0.001160515 seconds).
