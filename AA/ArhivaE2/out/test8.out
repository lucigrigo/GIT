The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 30315 nanoseconds (3.0315E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -52276 nanoseconds (-5.2276E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 82591 nanoseconds (8.2591E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (12) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 11
