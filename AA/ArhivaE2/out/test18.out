The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 863704 nanoseconds (8.63704E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 95190 nanoseconds (9.519E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 768514 nanoseconds (7.68514E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 142283 nanoseconds (1.42283E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 626231 nanoseconds (6.26231E-4 seconds).
