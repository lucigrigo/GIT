The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 581398 nanoseconds (5.81398E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -172615 nanoseconds (-1.72615E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 754013 nanoseconds (7.54013E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 167966 nanoseconds (1.67966E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 586047 nanoseconds (5.86047E-4 seconds).
