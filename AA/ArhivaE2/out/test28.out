The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 11674762 nanoseconds (0.011674762 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -267251 nanoseconds (-2.67251E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 11942013 nanoseconds (0.011942013 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 5873756 nanoseconds (0.005873756 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 6068257 nanoseconds (0.006068257 seconds).
