The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 11578306 nanoseconds (0.011578306 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -301959 nanoseconds (-3.01959E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 11880265 nanoseconds (0.011880265 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 5866300 nanoseconds (0.0058663 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 6013965 nanoseconds (0.006013965 seconds).
