The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 586817 nanoseconds (5.86817E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -67626 nanoseconds (-6.7626E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 654443 nanoseconds (6.54443E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
