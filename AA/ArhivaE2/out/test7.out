The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 55851 nanoseconds (5.5851E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -40290 nanoseconds (-4.029E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 96141 nanoseconds (9.6141E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 127
	match 3 at index 155

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 27319 nanoseconds (2.7319E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 127
	match 3 at index 155


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 68822 nanoseconds (6.8822E-5 seconds).
