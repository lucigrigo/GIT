The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 53810 nanoseconds (5.381E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -49077 nanoseconds (-4.9077E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 102887 nanoseconds (1.02887E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 127
	match 3 at index 155

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 25315 nanoseconds (2.5315E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 127
	match 3 at index 155


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 77572 nanoseconds (7.7572E-5 seconds).
