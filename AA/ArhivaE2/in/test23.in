Romeo and JulietShakespeare | Romeo and Juliet | Entire playACT IPROLOGUETwo households, both alike in dignity,In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.From forth the fatal loins of these two foesA pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;Whose misadventured piteous overthrowsDo with their death bury their parents' strife.The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,And the continuance of their parents' rage,Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;The which if you with patient ears attend,What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.SCENE I. Verona. A public place.Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklersSAMPSONGregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.GREGORYNo, for then we should be colliers.SAMPSONI mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.GREGORYAy, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.SAMPSONI strike quickly, being moved.GREGORYBut thou art not quickly moved to strike.SAMPSONA dog of the house of Montague moves me.GREGORYTo move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.SAMPSONA dog of that house shall move me to stand: I willtake the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.GREGORYThat shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goesto the wall.SAMPSONTrue; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will pushMontague's men from the wall, and thrust his maidsto the wall.GREGORYThe quarrel is between our masters and us their men.SAMPSON'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when Ihave fought with the men, I will be cruel with themaids, and cut off their heads.GREGORYThe heads of the maids?SAMPSONAy, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;take it in what sense thou wilt.GREGORYThey must take it in sense that feel it.SAMPSONMe they shall feel while I am able to stand: and'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.GREGORY'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thouhadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comestwo of the house of the Montagues.SAMPSONMy naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.GREGORYHow! turn thy back and run?SAMPSONFear me not.GREGORYNo, marry; I fear thee!SAMPSONLet us take the law of our sides; let them begin.GREGORYI will frown as I pass by, and let them take it asthey list.SAMPSONNay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASARABRAHAMDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?SAMPSONI do bite my thumb, sir.ABRAHAMDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?SAMPSON[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I sayay?GREGORYNo.SAMPSONNo, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but Ibite my thumb, sir.GREGORYDo you quarrel, sir?ABRAHAMQuarrel sir! no, sir.SAMPSONIf you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.ABRAHAMNo better.SAMPSONWell, sir.GREGORYSay 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.SAMPSONYes, better, sir.ABRAHAMYou lie.SAMPSONDraw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.They fightEnter BENVOLIOBENVOLIOPart, fools!Put up your swords; you know not what you do.Beats down their swordsEnter TYBALTTYBALTWhat, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.BENVOLIOI do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,Or manage it to part these men with me.TYBALTWhat, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:Have at thee, coward!They fightEnter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubsFirst CitizenClubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULETCAPULETWhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!LADY CAPULETA crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?CAPULETMy sword, I say! Old Montague is come,And flourishes his blade in spite of me.Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUEMONTAGUEThou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.LADY MONTAGUEThou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.Enter PRINCE, with AttendantsPRINCERebellious subjects, enemies to peace,Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,That quench the fire of your pernicious rageWith purple fountains issuing from your veins,On pain of torture, from those bloody handsThrow your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,And hear the sentence of your moved prince.Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,And made Verona's ancient citizensCast by their grave beseeming ornaments,To wield old partisans, in hands as old,Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:If ever you disturb our streets again,Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.For this time, all the rest depart away:You Capulet; shall go along with me:And, Montague, come you this afternoon,To know our further pleasure in this case,To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIOMONTAGUEWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?BENVOLIOHere were the servants of your adversary,And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:I drew to part them: in the instant cameThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,He swung about his head and cut the winds,Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,Came more and more and fought on part and part,Till the prince came, who parted either part.LADY MONTAGUEO, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?Right glad I am he was not at this fray.BENVOLIOMadam, an hour before the worshipp'd sunPeer'd forth the golden window of the east,A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;Where, underneath the grove of sycamoreThat westward rooteth from the city's side,So early walking did I see your son:Towards him I made, but he was ware of meAnd stole into the covert of the wood:I, measuring his affections by my own,That most are busied when they're most alone,Pursued my humour not pursuing his,And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.MONTAGUEMany a morning hath he there been seen,With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;But all so soon as the all-cheering sunShould in the furthest east begin to drawThe shady curtains from Aurora's bed,Away from the light steals home my heavy son,And private in his chamber pens himself,Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight outAnd makes himself an artificial night:Black and portentous must this humour prove,Unless good counsel may the cause remove.BENVOLIOMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?MONTAGUEI neither know it nor can learn of him.BENVOLIOHave you importuned him by any means?MONTAGUEBoth by myself and many other friends:But he, his own affections' counsellor,Is to himself--I will not say how true--But to himself so secret and so close,So far from sounding and discovery,As is the bud bit with an envious worm,Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.We would as willingly give cure as know.Enter ROMEOBENVOLIOSee, where he comes: so please you, step aside;I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.MONTAGUEI would thou wert so happy by thy stay,To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUEBENVOLIOGood-morrow, cousin.ROMEOIs the day so young?BENVOLIOBut new struck nine.ROMEOAy me! sad hours seem long.Was that my father that went hence so fast?BENVOLIOIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?ROMEONot having that, which, having, makes them short.BENVOLIOIn love?ROMEOOut--BENVOLIOOf love?ROMEOOut of her favour, where I am in love.BENVOLIOAlas, that love, so gentle in his view,Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!ROMEOAlas, that love, whose view is muffled still,Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!O any thing, of nothing first create!O heavy lightness! serious vanity!Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,sick health!Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!This love feel I, that feel no love in this.Dost thou not laugh?BENVOLIONo, coz, I rather weep.ROMEOGood heart, at what?BENVOLIOAt thy good heart's oppression.ROMEOWhy, such is love's transgression.Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prestWith more of thine: this love that thou hast shownDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:What is it else? a madness most discreet,A choking gall and a preserving sweet.Farewell, my coz.BENVOLIOSoft! I will go along;An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.ROMEOTut, I have lost myself; I am not here;This is not Romeo, he's some other where.BENVOLIOTell me in sadness, who is that you love.ROMEOWhat, shall I groan and tell thee?BENVOLIOGroan! why, no.But sadly tell me who.ROMEOBid a sick man in sadness make his will:Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.BENVOLIOI aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.ROMEOA right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.BENVOLIOA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.ROMEOWell, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hitWith Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.She will not stay the siege of loving terms,Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,That when she dies with beauty dies her store.BENVOLIOThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?ROMEOShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,For beauty starved with her severityCuts beauty off from all posterity.She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,To merit bliss by making me despair:She hath forsworn to love, and in that vowDo I live dead that live to tell it now.BENVOLIOBe ruled by me, forget to think of her.ROMEOO, teach me how I should forget to think.BENVOLIOBy giving liberty unto thine eyes;Examine other beauties.ROMEO'Tis the wayTo call hers exquisite, in question more:These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' browsBeing black put us in mind they hide the fair;He that is strucken blind cannot forgetThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost:Show me a mistress that is passing fair,What doth her beauty serve, but as a noteWhere I may read who pass'd that passing fair?Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.BENVOLIOI'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.ExeuntSCENE II. A street.Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and ServantCAPULETBut Montague is bound as well as I,In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,For men so old as we to keep the peace.PARISOf honourable reckoning are you both;And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?CAPULETBut saying o'er what I have said before:My child is yet a stranger in the world;She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,Let two more summers wither in their pride,Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.PARISYounger than she are happy mothers made.CAPULETAnd too soon marr'd are those so early made.The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,She is the hopeful lady of my earth:But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,My will to her consent is but a part;An she agree, within her scope of choiceLies my consent and fair according voice.This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,Whereto I have invited many a guest,Such as I love; and you, among the store,One more, most welcome, makes my number more.At my poor house look to behold this nightEarth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:Such comfort as do lusty young men feelWhen well-apparell'd April on the heelOf limping winter treads, even such delightAmong fresh female buds shall you this nightInherit at my house; hear all, all see,And like her most whose merit most shall be:Which on more view, of many mine being oneMay stand in number, though in reckoning none,Come, go with me.To Servant, giving a paperGo, sirrah, trudge aboutThrough fair Verona; find those persons outWhose names are written there, and to them say,My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.Exeunt CAPULET and PARISServantFind them out whose names are written here! It iswritten, that the shoemaker should meddle with hisyard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher withhis pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I amsent to find those persons whose names are herewrit, and can never find what names the writingperson hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEOBENVOLIOTut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;One desperate grief cures with another's languish:Take thou some new infection to thy eye,And the rank poison of the old will die.ROMEOYour plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.BENVOLIOFor what, I pray thee?ROMEOFor your broken shin.BENVOLIOWhy, Romeo, art thou mad?ROMEONot mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;Shut up in prison, kept without my food,Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.ServantGod gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?ROMEOAy, mine own fortune in my misery.ServantPerhaps you have learned it without book: but, Ipray, can you read any thing you see?ROMEOAy, if I know the letters and the language.ServantYe say honestly: rest you merry!ROMEOStay, fellow; I can read.Reads'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the ladywidow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovelynieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mineuncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair nieceRosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousinTybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fairassembly: whither should they come?ServantUp.ROMEOWhither?ServantTo supper; to our house.ROMEOWhose house?ServantMy master's.ROMEOIndeed, I should have ask'd you that before.ServantNow I'll tell you without asking: my master is thegreat rich Capulet; and if you be not of the houseof Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.Rest you merry!ExitBENVOLIOAt this same ancient feast of Capulet'sSups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,With all the admired beauties of Verona:Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,Compare her face with some that I shall show,And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.ROMEOWhen the devout religion of mine eyeMaintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;And these, who often drown'd could never die,Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sunNe'er saw her match since first the world begun.BENVOLIOTut, you saw her fair, none else being by,Herself poised with herself in either eye:But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'dYour lady's love against some other maidThat I will show you shining at this feast,And she shall scant show well that now shows best.ROMEOI'll go along, no such sight to be shown,But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.ExeuntSCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.Enter LADY CAPULET and NurseLADY CAPULETNurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.NurseNow, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!Enter JULIETJULIETHow now! who calls?NurseYour mother.JULIETMadam, I am here.What is your will?LADY CAPULETThis is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.NurseFaith, I can tell her age unto an hour.LADY CAPULETShe's not fourteen.NurseI'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--She is not fourteen. How long is it nowTo Lammas-tide?LADY CAPULETA fortnight and odd days.NurseEven or odd, of all days in the year,Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;She was too good for me: but, as I said,On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;That shall she, marry; I remember it well.'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--Of all the days of the year, upon that day:For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;My lord and you were then at Mantua:--Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,When it did taste the wormwood on the nippleOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,To bid me trudge:And since that time it is eleven years;For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,She could have run and waddled all about;For even the day before, she broke her brow:And then my husband--God be with his soul!A' was a merry man--took up the child:'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'To see, now, how a jest shall come about!I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'LADY CAPULETEnough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.NurseYes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'And yet, I warrant, it had upon its browA bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'JULIETAnd stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.NursePeace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:An I might live to see thee married once,I have my wish.LADY CAPULETMarry, that 'marry' is the very themeI came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,How stands your disposition to be married?JULIETIt is an honour that I dream not of.NurseAn honour! were not I thine only nurse,I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.LADY CAPULETWell, think of marriage now; younger than you,Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,Are made already mothers: by my count,I was your mother much upon these yearsThat you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.NurseA man, young lady! lady, such a manAs all the world--why, he's a man of wax.LADY CAPULETVerona's summer hath not such a flower.NurseNay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.LADY CAPULETWhat say you? can you love the gentleman?This night you shall behold him at our feast;Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;Examine every married lineament,And see how one another lends contentAnd what obscured in this fair volume liesFind written in the margent of his eyes.This precious book of love, this unbound lover,To beautify him, only lacks a cover:The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much prideFor fair without the fair within to hide:That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;So shall you share all that he doth possess,By having him, making yourself no less.NurseNo less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.LADY CAPULETSpeak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?JULIETI'll look to like, if looking liking move:But no more deep will I endart mine eyeThan your consent gives strength to make it fly.Enter a ServantServantMadam, the guests are come, supper served up, youcalled, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed inthe pantry, and every thing in extremity.

A street.Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and othersROMEOWhat, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?Or shall we on without a apology?BENVOLIOThe date is out of such prolixity:We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spokeAfter the prompter, for our entrance:But let them measure us by what they will;We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.ROMEOGive me a torch: I am not for this ambling;Being but heavy, I will bear the light.MERCUTIONay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.ROMEONot I, believe me: you have dancing shoesWith nimble soles: I have a soul of leadSo stakes me to the ground I cannot move.MERCUTIOYou are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,And soar with them above a common bound.ROMEOI am too sore enpierced with his shaftTo soar with his light feathers, and so bound,I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:Under love's heavy burden do I sink.MERCUTIOAnd, to sink in it, should you burden love;Too great oppression for a tender thing.ROMEOIs love a tender thing? it is too rough,Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.MERCUTIOIf love be rough with you, be rough with love;Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.Give me a case to put my visage in:A visor for a visor! what care IWhat curious eye doth quote deformities?Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.BENVOLIOCome, knock and enter; and no sooner in,But every man betake him to his legs.ROMEOA torch for me: let wantons light of heartTickle the senseless rushes with their heels,For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.MERCUTIOTut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mireOf this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'stUp to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!ROMEONay, that's not so.MERCUTIOI mean, sir, in delayWe waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.Take our good meaning, for our judgment sitsFive times in that ere once in our five wits.ROMEOAnd we mean well in going to this mask;But 'tis no wit to go.MERCUTIOWhy, may one ask?ROMEOI dream'd a dream to-night.MERCUTIOAnd so did I.ROMEOWell, what was yours?MERCUTIOThat dreamers often lie.ROMEOIn bed asleep, while they do dream things true.MERCUTIOO, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.She is the fairies' midwife, and she comesIn shape no bigger than an agate-stoneOn the fore-finger of an alderman,Drawn with a team of little atomiesAthwart men's noses as they lie asleep;Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,The traces of the smallest spider's web,The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,Not so big as a round little wormPrick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;Her chariot is an empty hazel-nutMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.And in this state she gallops night by nightThrough lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tailTickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,Then dreams, he of another benefice:Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anonDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,And being thus frighted swears a prayer or twoAnd sleeps again. This is that very MabThat plats the manes of horses in the night,And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,That presses them and learns them first to bear,Making them women of good carriage:This is she--ROMEOPeace, peace, Mercutio, peace!Thou talk'st of nothing.MERCUTIOTrue, I talk of dreams,Which are the children of an idle brain,Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,Which is as thin of substance as the airAnd more inconstant than the wind, who wooesEven now the frozen bosom of the north,And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.BENVOLIOThis wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;Supper is done, and we shall come too late.ROMEOI fear, too early: for my mind misgivesSome consequence yet hanging in the starsShall bitterly begin his fearful dateWith this night's revels and expire the termOf a despised life closed in my breastBy some vile forfeit of untimely death.But He, that hath the steerage of my course,Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.BENVOLIOStrike, drum.ExeuntSCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkinsFirst ServantWhere's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?

I have seen the dayThat I have worn a visor and could tellA whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.Music plays, and they danceMore light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;For you and I are past our dancing days:How long is't now since last yourself and IWere in a mask?Second CapuletBy'r lady, thirty years.CAPULETWhat, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,Come pentecost as quickly as it will,Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.Second Capulet'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;His son is thirty.CAPULETWill you tell me that?His son was but a ward two years ago.ROMEO[To a Servingman] What lady is that, which dothenrich the handOf yonder knight?ServantI know not, sir.ROMEOO, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!It seems she hangs upon the cheek of nightLike a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.TYBALTThis, by his voice, should be a Montague.Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slaveCome hither, cover'd with an antic face,To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.CAPULETWhy, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?TYBALTUncle, this is a Montague, our foe,A villain that is hither come in spite,To scorn at our solemnity this night.CAPULETYoung Romeo is it?TYBALT'Tis he, that villain Romeo.CAPULETContent thee, gentle coz, let him alone;He bears him like a portly gentleman;And, to say truth, Verona brags of himTo be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:I would not for the wealth of all the townHere in my house do him disparagement:Therefore be patient, take no note of him:It is my will, the which if thou respect,Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.TYBALTIt fits, when such a villain is a guest:I'll not endure him.CAPULETHe shall be endured:What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;Am I the master here, or you? go to.You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!You'll make a mutiny among my guests!You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!TYBALTWhy, uncle, 'tis a shame.CAPULETGo to, go to;You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.Well said, my hearts!

O, be some other name!What's in a name? that which we call a roseBy any other name would smell as sweet;So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,Retain that dear perfection which he owesWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name,And for that name which is no part of theeTake all myself.ROMEOI take thee at thy word:Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;Henceforth I never will be Romeo.JULIETWhat man art thou that thus bescreen'd in nightSo stumblest on my counsel?ROMEOBy a nameI know not how to tell thee who I am:My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,Because it is an enemy to thee;Had I it written, I would tear the word.JULIETMy ears have not yet drunk a hundred wordsOf that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?ROMEONeither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.JULIETHow camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,And the place death, considering who thou art,If any of my kinsmen find thee here.ROMEOWith love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;For stony limits cannot hold love out,And what love can do that dares love attempt;Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.JULIETIf they do see thee, they will murder thee.ROMEOAlack, there lies more peril in thine eyeThan twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,And I am proof against their enmity.JULIETI would not for the world they saw thee here.ROMEOI have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;And but thou love me, let them find me here:My life were better ended by their hate,Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.JULIETBy whose direction found'st thou out this place?ROMEOBy love, who first did prompt me to inquire;He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as farAs that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,I would adventure for such merchandise.JULIETThou know'st the mask of night is on my face,Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheekFor that which thou hast heard me speak to-nightFain would I dwell on form, fain, fain denyWhat I have spoke: but farewell compliment!Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuriesThen say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more trueThan those that have more cunning to be strange.I should have been more strange, I must confess,But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,And not impute this yielding to light love,Which the dark night hath so discovered.ROMEOLady, by yonder blessed moon I swearThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--JULIETO, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,That monthly changes in her circled orb,Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.ROMEOWhat shall I swear by?JULIETDo not swear at all;Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,Which is the god of my idolatry,And I'll believe thee.ROMEOIf my heart's dear love--JULIETWell, do not swear: although I joy in thee,I have no joy of this contract to-night:It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;Too like the lightning, which doth cease to beEre one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.Good night, good night! as sweet repose and restCome to thy heart as that within my breast!ROMEOO, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?JULIETWhat satisfaction canst thou have to-night?ROMEOThe exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.JULIETI gave thee mine before thou didst request it:And yet I would it were to give again.ROMEOWouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?JULIETBut to be frank, and give it thee again.And yet I wish but for the thing I have:My bounty is as boundless as the sea,My love as deep; the more I give to thee,The more I have, for both are infinite.Nurse calls withinI hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.Stay but a little, I will come again.Exit, aboveROMEOO blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.Being in night, all this is but a dream,Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.Re-enter JULIET, aboveJULIETThree words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.If that thy bent of love be honourable,Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,By one that I'll procure to come to thee,Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll layAnd follow thee my lord throughout the world.Nurse[Within] Madam!JULIETI come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,I do beseech thee--Nurse[Within] Madam!JULIETBy and by, I come:--To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:To-morrow will I send.ROMEOSo thrive my soul--JULIETA thousand times good night!Exit, aboveROMEOA thousand times the worse, to want thy light.Love goes toward love, as schoolboys fromtheir books,But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.RetiringRe-enter JULIET, aboveJULIETHist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,To lure this tassel-gentle back again!Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,With repetition of my Romeo's name.ROMEOIt is my soul that calls upon my name:How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,Like softest music to attending ears!JULIETRomeo!ROMEOMy dear?JULIETAt what o'clock to-morrowShall I send to thee?ROMEOAt the hour of nine.JULIETI will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.I have forgot why I did call thee back.ROMEOLet me stand here till thou remember it.JULIETI shall forget, to have thee still stand there,Remembering how I love thy company.ROMEOAnd I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,Forgetting any other home but this.JULIET'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:And yet no further than a wanton's bird;Who lets it hop a little from her hand,Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,And with a silk thread plucks it back again,So loving-jealous of his liberty.ROMEOI would I were thy bird.JULIETSweet, so would I:Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.Good night, good night! parting is suchsweet sorrow,That I shall say good night till it be morrow.Exit aboveROMEOSleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.ExitSCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basketFRIAR LAURENCEThe grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,And flecked darkness like a drunkard reelsFrom forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,I must up-fill this osier cage of oursWith baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;What is her burying grave that is her womb,And from her womb children of divers kindWe sucking on her natural bosom find,Many for many virtues excellent,None but for some and yet all different.O, mickle is the powerful grace that liesIn herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:For nought so vile that on the earth doth liveBut to the earth some special good doth give,Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair useRevolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;And vice sometimes by action dignified.Within the infant rind of this small flowerPoison hath residence and medicine power:For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.Two such opposed kings encamp them stillIn man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;And where the worser is predominant,Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.Enter ROMEOROMEOGood morrow, father.FRIAR LAURENCEBenedicite!What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?Young son, it argues a distemper'd headSo soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brainDoth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:Therefore thy earliness doth me assureThou art up-roused by some distemperature;Or if not so, then here I hit it right,Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.ROMEOThat last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.FRIAR LAURENCEGod pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?ROMEOWith Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.FRIAR LAURENCEThat's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?ROMEOI'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.I have been feasting with mine enemy,Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,That's by me wounded: both our remediesWithin thy help and holy physic lies:I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,My intercession likewise steads my foe.FRIAR LAURENCEBe plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.ROMEOThen plainly know my heart's dear love is setOn the fair daughter of rich Capulet:As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;And all combined, save what thou must combineBy holy marriage: when and where and howWe met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,That thou consent to marry us to-day.FRIAR LAURENCEHoly Saint Francis, what a change is here!Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,So soon forsaken? young men's love then liesNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.Jesu Maria, what a deal of brineHath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!How much salt water thrown away in waste,To season love, that of it doth not taste!The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sitOf an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.ROMEOThou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.FRIAR LAURENCEFor doting, not for loving, pupil mine.ROMEOAnd bad'st me bury love.FRIAR LAURENCENot in a grave,To lay one in, another out to have.ROMEOI pray thee, chide not; she whom I love nowDoth grace for grace and love for love allow;The other did not so.FRIAR LAURENCEO, she knew wellThy love did read by rote and could not spell.But come, young waverer, come, go with me,In one respect I'll thy assistant be;For this alliance may so happy prove,To turn your households' rancour to pure love.ROMEOO, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.FRIAR LAURENCEWisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.ExeuntSCENE IV.

O, he isthe courageous captain of compliments. He fights asyou sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, andproportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, andthe third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silkbutton, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of thevery first house, of the first and second cause:ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! thehai!BENVOLIOThe what?MERCUTIOThe pox of such antic, lisping, affectingfantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,a very good blade! a very tall man! a very goodwhore!'

Friar Laurence's cell.Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEOFRIAR LAURENCESo smile the heavens upon this holy act,That after hours with sorrow chide us not!ROMEOAmen, amen! but come what sorrow can,It cannot countervail the exchange of joyThat one short minute gives me in her sight:Do thou but close our hands with holy words,Then love-devouring death do what he dare;It is enough I may but call her mine.FRIAR LAURENCEThese violent delights have violent endsAnd in their triumph die, like fire and powder,Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honeyIs loathsome in his own deliciousnessAnd in the taste confounds the appetite:Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.Enter JULIETHere comes the lady: O, so light a footWill ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:A lover may bestride the gossamerThat idles in the wanton summer air,And yet not fall; so light is vanity.JULIETGood even to my ghostly confessor.FRIAR LAURENCERomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.JULIETAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.ROMEOAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joyBe heap'd like mine and that thy skill be moreTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breathThis neighbour air, and let rich music's tongueUnfold the imagined happiness that bothReceive in either by this dear encounter.JULIETConceit, more rich in matter than in words,Brags of his substance, not of ornament:They are but beggars that can count their worth;But my true love is grown to such excessI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.FRIAR LAURENCECome, come with me, and we will make short work;For, by your leaves, you shall not stay aloneTill holy church incorporate two in one.ExeuntACT IIISCENE I.

Thou! why,thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thouwilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having noother reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: whateye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full ofmeat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle asan egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with aman for coughing in the street, because he hathwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearinghis new doublet before Easter? with another, fortying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thouwilt tutor me from quarrelling!BENVOLIOAn I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any manshould buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.MERCUTIOThe fee-simple!

A plague o' both your houses!They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,And soundly too: your houses!Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIOROMEOThis gentleman, the prince's near ally,My very friend, hath got his mortal hurtIn my behalf; my reputation stain'dWith Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hourHath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,Thy beauty hath made me effeminateAnd in my temper soften'd valour's steel!Re-enter BENVOLIOBENVOLIOO Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.ROMEOThis day's black fate on more days doth depend;This but begins the woe, others must end.BENVOLIOHere comes the furious Tybalt back again.ROMEOAlive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!Away to heaven, respective lenity,And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!Re-enter TYBALTNow, Tybalt, take the villain back again,That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soulIs but a little way above our heads,Staying for thine to keep him company:Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.TYBALTThou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,Shalt with him hence.ROMEOThis shall determine that.They fight; TYBALT fallsBENVOLIORomeo, away, be gone!The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!ROMEOO, I am fortune's fool!BENVOLIOWhy dost thou stay?Exit ROMEOEnter Citizens, & cFirst CitizenWhich way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?BENVOLIOThere lies that Tybalt.First CitizenUp, sir, go with me;I charge thee in the princes name, obey.Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and othersPRINCEWhere are the vile beginners of this fray?BENVOLIOO noble prince, I can discover allThe unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.LADY CAPULETTybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spiltO my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.O cousin, cousin!PRINCEBenvolio, who began this bloody fray?BENVOLIOTybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethinkHow nice the quarrel was, and urged withalYour high displeasure: all this utteredWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,Could not take truce with the unruly spleenOf Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tiltsWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beatsCold death aside, and with the other sendsIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter thanhis tongue,His agile arm beats down their fatal points,And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose armAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the lifeOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;But by and by comes back to Romeo,Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere ICould draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.LADY CAPULETHe is a kinsman to the Montague;Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,And all those twenty could but kill one life.I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.PRINCERomeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?MONTAGUENot Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;His fault concludes but what the law should end,The life of Tybalt.PRINCEAnd for that offenceImmediately we do exile him hence:I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;But I'll amerce you with so strong a fineThat you shall all repent the loss of mine:I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.Bear hence this body and attend our will:Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.ExeuntSCENE II. Capulet's orchard.Enter JULIETJULIETGallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagonerAs Phaethon would whip you to the west,And bring in cloudy night immediately.Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,That runaway's eyes may wink and RomeoLeap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.Lovers can see to do their amorous ritesBy their own beauties; or, if love be blind,It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,And learn me how to lose a winning match,Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,Think true love acted simple modesty.Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;For thou wilt lie upon the wings of nightWhiter than new snow on a raven's back.Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,Take him and cut him out in little stars,And he will make the face of heaven so fineThat all the world will be in love with nightAnd pay no worship to the garish sun.O, I have bought the mansion of a love,But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this dayAs is the night before some festivalTo an impatient child that hath new robesAnd may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,And she brings news; and every tongue that speaksBut Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.Enter Nurse, with cordsNow, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cordsThat Romeo bid thee fetch?NurseAy, ay, the cords.Throws them downJULIETAy me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?NurseAh, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!We are undone, lady, we are undone!Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!JULIETCan heaven be so envious?NurseRomeo can,Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!JULIETWhat devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison moreThan the death-darting eye of cockatrice:I am not I, if there be such an I;Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.NurseI saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.JULIETO, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!NurseO Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!That ever I should live to see thee dead!JULIETWhat storm is this that blows so contrary?Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!For who is living, if those two are gone?NurseTybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.JULIETO God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?NurseIt did, it did; alas the day, it did!JULIETO serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!Despised substance of divinest show!Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,A damned saint, an honourable villain!O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiendIn moral paradise of such sweet flesh?Was ever book containing such vile matterSo fairly bound? O that deceit should dwellIn such a gorgeous palace!NurseThere's no trust,No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.Shame come to Romeo!JULIETBlister'd be thy tongueFor such a wish! he was not born to shame:Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'dSole monarch of the universal earth.O, what a beast was I to chide at him!NurseWill you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?JULIETShall I speak ill of him that is my husband?Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;Your tributary drops belong to woe,Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;But, O, it presses to my memory,Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's deathWas woe enough, if it had ended there:Or, if sour woe delights in fellowshipAnd needly will be rank'd with other griefs,Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,Which modern lamentations might have moved?But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?NurseWeeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.JULIETWash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:He made you for a highway to my bed;But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!NurseHie to your chamber: I'll find RomeoTo comfort you: I wot well where he is.Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.JULIETO, find him! give this ring to my true knight,And bid him come to take his last farewell.ExeuntSCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.Enter FRIAR LAURENCEFRIAR LAURENCERomeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,And thou art wedded to calamity.Enter ROMEOROMEOFather, what news? what is the prince's doom?What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,That I yet know not?FRIAR LAURENCEToo familiarIs my dear son with such sour company:I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.ROMEOWhat less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?FRIAR LAURENCEA gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,Not body's death, but body's banishment.ROMEOHa, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'For exile hath more terror in his look,Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'FRIAR LAURENCEHence from Verona art thou banished:Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.ROMEOThere is no world without Verona walls,But purgatory, torture, hell itself.Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,And world's exile is death: then banished,Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.FRIAR LAURENCEO deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,And turn'd that black word death to banishment:This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.ROMEO'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dogAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,Live here in heaven and may look on her;But Romeo may not: more validity,More honourable state, more courtship livesIn carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seizeOn the white wonder of dear Juliet's handAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,Who even in pure and vestal modesty,Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;But Romeo may not; he is banished:Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:They are free men, but I am banished.And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?O friar, the damned use that word in hell;Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,To mangle me with that word 'banished'?FRIAR LAURENCEThou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.ROMEOO, thou wilt speak again of banishment.FRIAR LAURENCEI'll give thee armour to keep off that word:Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,To comfort thee, though thou art banished.ROMEOYet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.FRIAR LAURENCEO, then I see that madmen have no ears.ROMEOHow should they, when that wise men have no eyes?FRIAR LAURENCELet me dispute with thee of thy estate.ROMEOThou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,Doting like me and like me banished,Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,And fall upon the ground, as I do now,Taking the measure of an unmade grave.Knocking withinFRIAR LAURENCEArise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.ROMEONot I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.KnockingFRIAR LAURENCEHark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;KnockingRun to my study. By and by! God's will,What simpleness is this! I come, I come!KnockingWho knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?Nurse[Within] Let me come in, and you shall knowmy errand;I come from Lady Juliet.FRIAR LAURENCEWelcome, then.Enter NurseNurseO holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?FRIAR LAURENCEThere on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.NurseO, he is even in my mistress' case,Just in her case! O woful sympathy!Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;Why should you fall into so deep an O?ROMEONurse!NurseAh sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.ROMEOSpakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?Doth she not think me an old murderer,Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joyWith blood removed but little from her own?Where is she? and how doth she? and what saysMy conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?NurseO, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,And then down falls again.ROMEOAs if that name,Shot from the deadly level of a gun,Did murder her; as that name's cursed handMurder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,In what vile part of this anatomyDoth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sackThe hateful mansion.Drawing his swordFRIAR LAURENCEHold thy desperate hand:Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denoteThe unreasonable fury of a beast:Unseemly woman in a seeming man!Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,I thought thy disposition better temper'd.Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,By doing damned hate upon thyself?Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meetIn thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,And usest none in that true use indeedWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,Digressing from the valour of a man;Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,Misshapen in the conduct of them both,Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,Is set afire by thine own ignorance,And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friendAnd turns it to exile; there art thou happy:A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;Happiness courts thee in her best array;But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:But look thou stay not till the watch be set,For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;Where thou shalt live, till we can find a timeTo blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee backWith twenty hundred thousand times more joyThan thou went'st forth in lamentation.Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;And bid her hasten all the house to bed,Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:Romeo is coming.NurseO Lord, I could have stay'd here all the nightTo hear good counsel: O, what learning is!My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.ROMEODo so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.NurseHere, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.ExitROMEOHow well my comfort is revived by this!FRIAR LAURENCEGo hence; good night; and here stands all your state:Either be gone before the watch be set,Or by the break of day disguised from hence:Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,And he shall signify from time to timeEvery good hap to you that chances here:Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.ROMEOBut that a joy past joy calls out on me,It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.ExeuntSCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARISCAPULETThings have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,That we have had no time to move our daughter:Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:I promise you, but for your company,I would have been a-bed an hour ago.PARISThese times of woe afford no time to woo.Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.LADY CAPULETI will, and know her mind early to-morrow;To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.CAPULETSir Paris, I will make a desperate tenderOf my child's love: I think she will be ruledIn all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--But, soft! what day is this?PARISMonday, my lord,CAPULETMonday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,She shall be married to this noble earl.Will you be ready? do you like this haste?We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,It may be thought we held him carelessly,Being our kinsman, if we revel much:Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?PARISMy lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.CAPULETWell get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!Afore me! it is so very very late,That we may call it early by and by.Good night.ExeuntSCENE V. Capulet's orchard.Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the windowJULIETWilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:It was the nightingale, and not the lark,That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.ROMEOIt was the lark, the herald of the morn,No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaksDo lace the severing clouds in yonder east:Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund dayStands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.I must be gone and live, or stay and die.JULIETYon light is not day-light, I know it, I:It is some meteor that the sun exhales,To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,And light thee on thy way to Mantua:Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.ROMEOLet me be ta'en, let me be put to death;I am content, so thou wilt have it so.I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beatThe vaulty heaven so high above our heads:I have more care to stay than will to go:Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.JULIETIt is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!It is the lark that sings so out of tune,Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.Some say the lark makes sweet division;This doth not so, for she divideth us:Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,O, now I would they had changed voices too!Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.ROMEOMore light and light; more dark and dark our woes!Enter Nurse, to the chamberNurseMadam!JULIETNurse?NurseYour lady mother is coming to your chamber:The day is broke; be wary, look about.ExitJULIETThen, window, let day in, and let life out.ROMEOFarewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.He goeth downJULIETArt thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!I must hear from thee every day in the hour,For in a minute there are many days:O, by this count I shall be much in yearsEre I again behold my Romeo!ROMEOFarewell!I will omit no opportunityThat may convey my greetings, love, to thee.JULIETO think'st thou we shall ever meet again?ROMEOI doubt it not; and all these woes shall serveFor sweet discourses in our time to come.JULIETO God, I have an ill-divining soul!Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.ROMEOAnd trust me, love, in my eye so do you:Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!ExitJULIETO fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,But send him back.LADY CAPULET[Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?JULIETWho is't that calls? is it my lady mother?Is she not down so late, or up so early?What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?Enter LADY CAPULETLADY CAPULETWhy, how now, Juliet!JULIETMadam, I am not well.LADY CAPULETEvermore weeping for your cousin's death?What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;But much of grief shows still some want of wit.JULIETYet let me weep for such a feeling loss.LADY CAPULETSo shall you feel the loss, but not the friendWhich you weep for.JULIETFeeling so the loss,Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.LADY CAPULETWell, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.JULIETWhat villain madam?LADY CAPULETThat same villain, Romeo.JULIET[Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.LADY CAPULETThat is, because the traitor murderer lives.JULIETAy, madam, from the reach of these my hands:Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!LADY CAPULETWe will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.JULIETIndeed, I never shall be satisfiedWith Romeo, till I behold him--dead--Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.Madam, if you could find out but a manTo bear a poison, I would temper it;That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhorsTo hear him named, and cannot come to him.To wreak the love I bore my cousinUpon his body that slaughter'd him!LADY CAPULETFind thou the means, and I'll find such a man.But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.JULIETAnd joy comes well in such a needy time:What are they, I beseech your ladyship?LADY CAPULETWell, well, thou hast a careful father, child;One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.JULIETMadam, in happy time, what day is that?LADY CAPULETMarry, my child, early next Thursday morn,The gallant, young and noble gentleman,The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.JULIETNow, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,He shall not make me there a joyful bride.I wonder at this haste; that I must wedEre he, that should be husband, comes to woo.I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!LADY CAPULETHere comes your father; tell him so yourself,And see how he will take it at your hands.Enter CAPULET and NurseCAPULETWhen the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;But for the sunset of my brother's sonIt rains downright.How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?Evermore showering? In one little bodyThou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,Without a sudden calm, will oversetThy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!Have you deliver'd to her our decree?LADY CAPULETAy, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.I would the fool were married to her grave!CAPULETSoft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,Unworthy as she is, that we have wroughtSo worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?JULIETNot proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:Proud can I never be of what I hate;But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.CAPULETHow now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!You tallow-face!LADY CAPULETFie, fie! what, are you mad?JULIETGood father, I beseech you on my knees,Hear me with patience but to speak a word.CAPULETHang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,Or never after look me in the face:Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blestThat God had lent us but this only child;But now I see this one is one too much,And that we have a curse in having her:Out on her, hilding!NurseGod in heaven bless her!You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.CAPULETAnd why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.NurseI speak no treason.CAPULETO, God ye god-den.NurseMay not one speak?CAPULETPeace, you mumbling fool!Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;For here we need it not.LADY CAPULETYou are too hot.CAPULETGod's bread! it makes me mad:Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,Alone, in company, still my care hath beenTo have her match'd: and having now providedA gentleman of noble parentage,Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;And then to have a wretched puling fool,A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:Graze where you will you shall not house with me:Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die inthe streets,For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.ExitJULIETIs there no pity sitting in the clouds,That sees into the bottom of my grief?O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!Delay this marriage for a month, a week;Or, if you do not, make the bridal bedIn that dim monument where Tybalt lies.LADY CAPULETTalk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.ExitJULIETO God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;How shall that faith return again to earth,Unless that husband send it me from heavenBy leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagemsUpon so soft a subject as myself!What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?Some comfort, nurse.NurseFaith, here it is.Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,I think it best you married with the county.O, he's a lovely gentleman!Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eyeAs Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,I think you are happy in this second match,For it excels your first: or if it did not,Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,As living here and you no use of him.JULIETSpeakest thou from thy heart?NurseAnd from my soul too;Or else beshrew them both.JULIETAmen!NurseWhat?JULIETWell, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,To make confession and to be absolved.NurseMarry, I will; and this is wisely done.ExitJULIETAncient damnation! O most wicked fiend!Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongueWhich she hath praised him with above compareSo many thousand times? Go, counsellor;Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:If all else fail, myself have power to die.ExitACT IVSCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARISFRIAR LAURENCEOn Thursday, sir? the time is very short.PARISMy father Capulet will have it so;And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.FRIAR LAURENCEYou say you do not know the lady's mind:Uneven is the course, I like it not.PARISImmoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,And therefore have I little talk'd of love;For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.Now, sir, her father counts it dangerousThat she doth give her sorrow so much sway,And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,To stop the inundation of her tears;Which, too much minded by herself alone,May be put from her by society:Now do you know the reason of this haste.FRIAR LAURENCE[Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.Enter JULIETPARISHappily met, my lady and my wife!JULIETThat may be, sir, when I may be a wife.PARISThat may be must be, love, on Thursday next.JULIETWhat must be shall be.FRIAR LAURENCEThat's a certain text.PARISCome you to make confession to this father?JULIETTo answer that, I should confess to you.PARISDo not deny to him that you love me.JULIETI will confess to you that I love him.PARISSo will ye, I am sure, that you love me.JULIETIf I do so, it will be of more price,Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.PARISPoor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.JULIETThe tears have got small victory by that;For it was bad enough before their spite.PARISThou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.JULIETThat is no slander, sir, which is a truth;And what I spake, I spake it to my face.PARISThy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.JULIETIt may be so, for it is not mine own.Are you at leisure, holy father, now;Or shall I come to you at evening mass?FRIAR LAURENCEMy leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.My lord, we must entreat the time alone.PARISGod shield I should disturb devotion!Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.ExitJULIETO shut the door! and when thou hast done so,Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!FRIAR LAURENCEAh, Juliet, I already know thy grief;It strains me past the compass of my wits:I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,On Thursday next be married to this county.JULIETTell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,Do thou but call my resolution wise,And with this knife I'll help it presently.God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,Shall be the label to another deed,Or my true heart with treacherous revoltTurn to another, this shall slay them both:Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,Give me some present counsel, or, behold,'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knifeShall play the umpire, arbitrating thatWhich the commission of thy years and artCould to no issue of true honour bring.Be not so long to speak; I long to die,If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.FRIAR LAURENCEHold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,Which craves as desperate an execution.As that is desperate which we would prevent.If, rather than to marry County Paris,Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,Then is it likely thou wilt undertakeA thing like death to chide away this shame,That copest with death himself to scape from it:And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.JULIETO, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,From off the battlements of yonder tower;Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurkWhere serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;Or bid me go into a new-made graveAnd hide me with a dead man in his shroud;Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;And I will do it without fear or doubt,To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.FRIAR LAURENCEHold, then; go home, be merry, give consentTo marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:Take thou this vial, being then in bed,And this distilled liquor drink thou off;When presently through all thy veins shall runA cold and drowsy humour, for no pulseShall keep his native progress, but surcease:No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fadeTo paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;Each part, deprived of supple government,Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk deathThou shalt continue two and forty hours,And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comesTo rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:Then, as the manner of our country is,In thy best robes uncover'd on the bierThou shalt be borne to that same ancient vaultWhere all the kindred of the Capulets lie.In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,And hither shall he come: and he and IWill watch thy waking, and that very nightShall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.And this shall free thee from this present shame;If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,Abate thy valour in the acting it.JULIETGive me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!FRIAR LAURENCEHold; get you gone, be strong and prosperousIn this resolve: I'll send a friar with speedTo Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.JULIETLove give me strength! and strength shall help afford.Farewell, dear father!ExeuntSCENE II.

Let me see the county;Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,Our whole city is much bound to him.JULIETNurse, will you go with me into my closet,To help me sort such needful ornamentsAs you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?LADY CAPULETNo, not till Thursday; there is time enough.CAPULETGo, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.Exeunt JULIET and NurseLADY CAPULETWe shall be short in our provision:'Tis now near night.CAPULETTush, I will stir about,And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;I'll play the housewife for this once.

Is my father well?How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;For nothing can be ill, if she be well.BALTHASARThen she is well, and nothing can be ill:Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,And her immortal part with angels lives.I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,And presently took post to tell it you:O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,Since you did leave it for my office, sir.ROMEOIs it even so? then I defy you, stars!Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.BALTHASARI do beseech you, sir, have patience:Your looks are pale and wild, and do importSome misadventure.ROMEOTush, thou art deceived:Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?BALTHASARNo, my good lord.ROMEONo matter: get thee gone,And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.Exit BALTHASARWell, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swiftTo enter in the thoughts of desperate men!I do remember an apothecary,--And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I notedIn tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,An alligator stuff'd, and other skinsOf ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelvesA beggarly account of empty boxes,Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.Noting this penury, to myself I said'An if a man did need a poison now,Whose sale is present death in Mantua,Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'O, this same thought did but forerun my need;And this same needy man must sell it me.As I remember, this should be the house.Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.What, ho! apothecary!Enter ApothecaryApothecaryWho calls so loud?ROMEOCome hither, man. I see that thou art poor:Hold, there is forty ducats: let me haveA dram of poison, such soon-speeding gearAs will disperse itself through all the veinsThat the life-weary taker may fall deadAnd that the trunk may be discharged of breathAs violently as hasty powder firedDoth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.ApothecarySuch mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's lawIs death to any he that utters them.ROMEOArt thou so bare and full of wretchedness,And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;The world affords no law to make thee rich;Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.ApothecaryMy poverty, but not my will, consents.ROMEOI pay thy poverty, and not thy will.ApothecaryPut this in any liquid thing you will,And drink it off; and, if you had the strengthOf twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.ROMEOThere is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,Doing more murders in this loathsome world,Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.Come, cordial and not poison, go with meTo Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.ExeuntSCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.Enter FRIAR JOHNFRIAR JOHNHoly Franciscan friar! brother, ho!Enter FRIAR LAURENCEFRIAR LAURENCEThis same should be the voice of Friar John.Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.FRIAR JOHNGoing to find a bare-foot brother outOne of our order, to associate me,Here in this city visiting the sick,And finding him, the searchers of the town,Suspecting that we both were in a houseWhere the infectious pestilence did reign,Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.FRIAR LAURENCEWho bare my letter, then, to Romeo?FRIAR JOHNI could not send it,--here it is again,--Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,So fearful were they of infection.FRIAR LAURENCEUnhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,The letter was not nice but full of chargeOf dear import, and the neglecting itMay do much danger. Friar John, go hence;Get me an iron crow, and bring it straightUnto my cell.FRIAR JOHNBrother, I'll go and bring it thee.ExitFRIAR LAURENCENow must I to the monument alone;Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:She will beshrew me much that RomeoHath had no notice of these accidents;But I will write again to Mantua,And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!ExitSCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torchPARISGive me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,As signal that thou hear'st something approach.Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.PAGE[Aside] I am almost afraid to stand aloneHere in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.RetiresPARISSweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:The obsequies that I for thee will keepNightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.The Page whistlesThe boy gives warning something doth approach.What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.RetiresEnter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, & cROMEOGive me that mattock and the wrenching iron.Hold, take this letter; early in the morningSee thou deliver it to my lord and father.Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,And do not interrupt me in my course.Why I descend into this bed of death,Is partly to behold my lady's face;But chiefly to take thence from her dead fingerA precious ring, a ring that I must useIn dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:But if thou, jealous, dost return to pryIn what I further shall intend to do,By heaven, I will tear thee joint by jointAnd strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:The time and my intents are savage-wild,More fierce and more inexorable farThan empty tigers or the roaring sea.BALTHASARI will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.ROMEOSo shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.BALTHASAR[Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.RetiresROMEOThou detestable maw, thou womb of death,Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!Opens the tombPARISThis is that banish'd haughty Montague,That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,It is supposed, the fair creature died;And here is come to do some villanous shameTo the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.Comes forwardStop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!Can vengeance be pursued further than death?Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.ROMEOI must indeed; and therefore came I hither.Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,Put not another sin upon my head,By urging me to fury: O, be gone!By heaven, I love thee better than myself;For I come hither arm'd against myself:Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,A madman's mercy bade thee run away.PARISI do defy thy conjurations,And apprehend thee for a felon here.ROMEOWilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!They fightPAGEO Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.ExitPARISO, I am slain!FallsIf thou be merciful,Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.DiesROMEOIn faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!What said my man, when my betossed soulDid not attend him as we rode? I thinkHe told me Paris should have married Juliet:Said he not so? or did I dream it so?Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makesThis vault a feasting presence full of light.Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.Laying PARIS in the tombHow oft when men are at the point of deathHave they been merry! which their keepers callA lightning before death: O, how may ICall this a lightning? O my love! my wife!Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yetIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,And death's pale flag is not advanced there.Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?O, what more favour can I do to thee,Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twainTo sunder his that was thine enemy?Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believeThat unsubstantial death is amorous,And that the lean abhorred monster keepsThee here in dark to be his paramour?For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;And never from this palace of dim nightDepart again: here, here will I remainWith worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, hereWill I set up my everlasting rest,And shake the yoke of inauspicious starsFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O youThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kissA dateless bargain to engrossing death!Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!Thou desperate pilot, now at once run onThe dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!Here's to my love!DrinksO true apothecary!Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.DiesEnter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spadeFRIAR LAURENCESaint Francis be my speed! how oft to-nightHave my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?BALTHASARHere's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.FRIAR LAURENCEBliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,What torch is yond, that vainly lends his lightTo grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,It burneth in the Capel's monument.BALTHASARIt doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,One that you love.FRIAR LAURENCEWho is it?BALTHASARRomeo.FRIAR LAURENCEHow long hath he been there?BALTHASARFull half an hour.FRIAR LAURENCEGo with me to the vault.BALTHASARI dare not, sirMy master knows not but I am gone hence;And fearfully did menace me with death,If I did stay to look on his intents.FRIAR LAURENCEStay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.BALTHASARAs I did sleep under this yew-tree here,I dreamt my master and another fought,And that my master slew him.FRIAR LAURENCERomeo!AdvancesAlack, alack, what blood is this, which stainsThe stony entrance of this sepulchre?What mean these masterless and gory swordsTo lie discolour'd by this place of peace?Enters the tombRomeo!

Where is my Romeo?Noise withinFRIAR LAURENCEI hear some noise. Lady, come from that nestOf death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:A greater power than we can contradictHath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of theeAmong a sisterhood of holy nuns:Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;Come, go, good Juliet,Noise againI dare no longer stay.JULIETGo, get thee hence, for I will not away.Exit FRIAR LAURENCEWhat's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly dropTo help me after?

O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his houseIs empty on the back of Montague,--And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!LADY CAPULETO me! this sight of death is as a bell,That warns my old age to a sepulchre.Enter MONTAGUE and othersPRINCECome, Montague; for thou art early up,To see thy son and heir more early down.MONTAGUEAlas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:What further woe conspires against mine age?PRINCELook, and thou shalt see.MONTAGUEO thou untaught! what manners is in this?To press before thy father to a grave?PRINCESeal up the mouth of outrage for a while,Till we can clear these ambiguities,And know their spring, their head, theirtrue descent;And then will I be general of your woes,And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,And let mischance be slave to patience.Bring forth the parties of suspicion.FRIAR LAURENCEI am the greatest, able to do least,Yet most suspected, as the time and placeDoth make against me of this direful murder;And here I stand, both to impeach and purgeMyself condemned and myself excused.PRINCEThen say at once what thou dost know in this.FRIAR LAURENCEI will be brief, for my short date of breathIs not so long as is a tedious tale.Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:I married them; and their stol'n marriage-dayWas Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely deathBanish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.You, to remove that siege of grief from her,Betroth'd and would have married her perforceTo County Paris: then comes she to me,And, with wild looks, bid me devise some meanTo rid her from this second marriage,Or in my cell there would she kill herself.Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,A sleeping potion; which so took effectAs I intended, for it wrought on herThe form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,That he should hither come as this dire night,To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,Being the time the potion's force should cease.But he which bore my letter, Friar John,Was stay'd by accident, and yesternightReturn'd my letter back. Then all aloneAt the prefixed hour of her waking,Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:But when I came, some minute ere the timeOf her awaking, here untimely layThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,And bear this work of heaven with patience:But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;And she, too desperate, would not go with me,But, as it seems, did violence on herself.All this I know; and to the marriageHer nurse is privy: and, if aught in thisMiscarried by my fault, let my old lifeBe sacrificed, some hour before his time,Unto the rigour of severest law.PRINCEWe still have known thee for a holy man.Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?BALTHASARI brought my master news of Juliet's death;And then in post he came from MantuaTo this same place, to this same monument.This letter he early bid me give his father,And threatened me with death, going in the vault,I departed not and left him there.PRINCEGive me the letter; I will look on it.Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?Sirrah, what made your master in this place?PAGEHe came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;And by and by my master drew on him;And then I ran away to call the watch.PRINCEThis letter doth make good the friar's words,Their course of love, the tidings of her death:And here he writes that he did buy a poisonOf a poor 'pothecary, and therewithalCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.And I for winking at your discords tooHave lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.CAPULETO brother Montague, give me thy hand:This is my daughter's jointure, for no moreCan I demand.MONTAGUEBut I can give thee more:For I will raise her statue in pure gold;That while Verona by that name is known,There shall no figure at such rate be setAs that of true and faithful Juliet.CAPULETAs rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;Poor sacrifices of our enmity!PRINCEA glooming peace this morning with it brings;The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:For never was a story of more woeThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.Exeunt The Tragedy of CoriolanusShakespeare homepage | Coriolanus | Entire playACT ISCENE I. Rome. A street.Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weaponsFirst CitizenBefore we proceed any further, hear me speak.AllSpeak, speak.First CitizenYou are all resolved rather to die than to famish?AllResolved. resolved.First CitizenFirst, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.AllWe know't, we know't.First CitizenLet us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.Is't a verdict?AllNo more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!Second CitizenOne word, good citizens.First CitizenWe are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if theywould yield us but the superfluity, while it werewholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;but they think we are too dear: the leanness thatafflicts us, the object of our misery, is as aninventory to particularise their abundance; oursufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this withour pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know Ispeak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.Second CitizenWould you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?AllAgainst him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.Second CitizenConsider you what services he has done for his country?First CitizenVery well; and could be content to give him goodreport fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.Second CitizenNay, but speak not maliciously.First CitizenI say unto you, what he hath done famously, he didit to that end: though soft-conscienced men can becontent to say it was for his country he did it toplease his mother and to be partly proud; which heis, even till the altitude of his virtue.Second CitizenWhat he cannot help in his nature, you account avice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.First CitizenIf I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.Shouts withinWhat shouts are these? The other side o' the cityis risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!AllCome, come.First CitizenSoft! who comes here?Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPASecond CitizenWorthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always lovedthe people.First CitizenHe's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!MENENIUSWhat work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go youWith bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.First CitizenOur business is not unknown to the senate; they havehad inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poorsuitors have strong breaths: they shall know wehave strong arms too.MENENIUSWhy, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,Will you undo yourselves?First CitizenWe cannot, sir, we are undone already.MENENIUSI tell you, friends, most charitable careHave the patricians of you. For your wants,Your suffering in this dearth, you may as wellStrike at the heaven with your staves as lift themAgainst the Roman state, whose course will onThe way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbsOf more strong link asunder than can everAppear in your impediment. For the dearth,The gods, not the patricians, make it, andYour knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,You are transported by calamityThither where more attends you, and you slanderThe helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,When you curse them as enemies.First CitizenCare for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for usyet: suffer us to famish, and their store-housescrammed with grain; make edicts for usury, tosupport usurers; repeal daily any wholesome actestablished against the rich, and provide morepiercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrainthe poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; andthere's all the love they bear us.MENENIUSEither you mustConfess yourselves wondrous malicious,Or be accused of folly. I shall tell youA pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;But, since it serves my purpose, I will ventureTo stale 't a little more.First CitizenWell, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think tofob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't pleaseyou, deliver.MENENIUSThere was a time when all the body's membersRebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:That only like a gulf it did remainI' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,Still cupboarding the viand, never bearingLike labour with the rest, where the other instrumentsDid see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,And, mutually participate, did ministerUnto the appetite and affection commonOf the whole body. The belly answer'd--First CitizenWell, sir, what answer made the belly?MENENIUSSir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--For, look you, I may make the belly smileAs well as speak--it tauntingly repliedTo the discontented members, the mutinous partsThat envied his receipt; even so most fitlyAs you malign our senators for thatThey are not such as you.First CitizenYour belly's answer? What!The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.With other muniments and petty helpsIn this our fabric, if that they--MENENIUSWhat then?'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?First CitizenShould by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,Who is the sink o' the body,--MENENIUSWell, what then?First CitizenThe former agents, if they did complain,What could the belly answer?MENENIUSI will tell youIf you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.First CitizenYe're long about it.MENENIUSNote me this, good friend;Your most grave belly was deliberate,Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,'That I receive the general food at first,Which you do live upon; and fit it is,Because I am the store-house and the shopOf the whole body: but, if you do remember,I send it through the rivers of your blood,Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;And, through the cranks and offices of man,The strongest nerves and small inferior veinsFrom me receive that natural competencyWhereby they live: and though that all at once,You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--First CitizenAy, sir; well, well.MENENIUS'Though all at once cannotSee what I do deliver out to each,Yet I can make my audit up, that allFrom me do back receive the flour of all,And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?First CitizenIt was an answer: how apply you this?MENENIUSThe senators of Rome are this good belly,And you the mutinous members; for examineTheir counsels and their cares, digest things rightlyTouching the weal o' the common, you shall findNo public benefit which you receiveBut it proceeds or comes from them to youAnd no way from yourselves. What do you think,You, the great toe of this assembly?First CitizenI the great toe! why the great toe?MENENIUSFor that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,Lead'st first to win some vantage.But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;The one side must have bale.Enter CAIUS MARCIUSHail, noble Marcius!MARCIUSThanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,Make yourselves scabs?First CitizenWe have ever your good word.MARCIUSHe that will give good words to thee will flatterBeneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue isTo make him worthy whose offence subdues himAnd curse that justice did it.Who deserves greatnessDeserves your hate; and your affections areA sick man's appetite, who desires most thatWhich would increase his evil. He that dependsUpon your favours swims with fins of leadAnd hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?With every minute you do change a mind,And call him noble that was now your hate,Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,That in these several places of the cityYou cry against the noble senate, who,Under the gods, keep you in awe, which elseWould feed on one another? What's their seeking?MENENIUSFor corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,The city is well stored.MARCIUSHang 'em! They say!They'll sit by the fire, and presume to knowWhat's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,Who thrives and who declines; side factionsand give outConjectural marriages; making parties strongAnd feebling such as stand not in their likingBelow their cobbled shoes. They say there'sgrain enough!Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarryWith thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as highAs I could pick my lance.MENENIUSNay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;For though abundantly they lack discretion,Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,What says the other troop?MARCIUSThey are dissolved: hang 'em!They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent notCorn for the rich men only: with these shredsThey vented their complainings; which being answer'd,And a petition granted them, a strange one--To break the heart of generosity,And make bold power look pale--they threw their capsAs they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,Shouting their emulation.MENENIUSWhat is granted them?MARCIUSFive tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in timeWin upon power and throw forth greater themesFor insurrection's arguing.MENENIUSThis is strange.MARCIUSGo, get you home, you fragments!Enter a Messenger, hastilyMessengerWhere's Caius Marcius?MARCIUSHere: what's the matter?MessengerThe news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.MARCIUSI am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to ventOur musty superfluity. See, our best elders.Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators; JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUSFirst SenatorMarcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;The Volsces are in arms.MARCIUSThey have a leader,Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.I sin in envying his nobility,And were I any thing but what I am,I would wish me only he.COMINIUSYou have fought together.MARCIUSWere half to half the world by the ears and he.Upon my party, I'ld revolt to makeOnly my wars with him: he is a lionThat I am proud to hunt.First SenatorThen, worthy Marcius,Attend upon Cominius to these wars.COMINIUSIt is your former promise.MARCIUSSir, it is;And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thouShalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?TITUSNo, Caius Marcius;I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,Ere stay behind this business.MENENIUSO, true-bred!First SenatorYour company to the Capitol; where, I know,Our greatest friends attend us.TITUS[To COMINIUS] Lead you on.To MARCIUSRight worthy you priority.COMINIUSNoble Marcius!First Senator[To the Citizens] Hence to your homes; be gone!MARCIUSNay, let them follow:The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thitherTo gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUSSICINIUSWas ever man so proud as is this Marcius?BRUTUSHe has no equal.SICINIUSWhen we were chosen tribunes for the people,--BRUTUSMark'd you his lip and eyes?SICINIUSNay. but his taunts.BRUTUSBeing moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.SICINIUSBe-mock the modest moon.BRUTUSThe present wars devour him: he is grownToo proud to be so valiant.SICINIUSSuch a nature,Tickled with good success, disdains the shadowWhich he treads on at noon: but I do wonderHis insolence can brook to be commandedUnder Cominius.BRUTUSFame, at the which he aims,In whom already he's well graced, can notBetter be held nor more attain'd than byA place below the first: for what miscarriesShall be the general's fault, though he performTo the utmost of a man, and giddy censureWill then cry out of Marcius 'O if heHad borne the business!'SICINIUSBesides, if things go well,Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shallOf his demerits rob Cominius.BRUTUSCome:Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faultsTo Marcius shall be honours, though indeedIn aught he merit not.SICINIUSLet's hence, and hearHow the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,More than his singularity, he goesUpon this present action.BRUTUSLets along.ExeuntSCENE II.

'Tis not four days goneSince I heard thence; these are the words: I thinkI have the letter here; yes, here it is.Reads'They have press'd a power, but it is not knownWhether for east or west: the dearth is great;The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,These three lead on this preparationWhither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:Consider of it.'First SenatorOur army's in the fieldWe never yet made doubt but Rome was readyTo answer us.AUFIDIUSNor did you think it follyTo keep your great pretences veil'd till whenThey needs must show themselves; whichin the hatching,It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which wasTo take in many towns ere almost RomeShould know we were afoot.Second SenatorNoble Aufidius,Take your commission; hie you to your bands:Let us alone to guard Corioli:If they set down before 's, for the removeBring your army; but, I think, you'll findThey've not prepared for us.AUFIDIUSO, doubt not that;I speak from certainties. Nay, more,Some parcels of their power are forth already,And only hitherward. I leave your honours.If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strikeTill one can do no more.AllThe gods assist you!AUFIDIUSAnd keep your honours safe!First SenatorFarewell.Second SenatorFarewell.AllFarewell.ExeuntSCENE III.

When yet he was buttender-bodied and the only son of my womb, whenyouth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, whenfor a day of kings' entreaties a mother should notsell him an hour from her beholding, I, consideringhow honour would become such a person. that it wasno better than picture-like to hang by the wall, ifrenown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seekdanger where he was like to find fame. To a cruelwar I sent him; from whence he returned, his browsbound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang notmore in joy at first hearing he was a man-childthan now in first seeing he had proved himself aman.VIRGILIABut had he died in the business, madam; how then?VOLUMNIAThen his good report should have been my son; Itherein would have found issue. Hear me professsincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my lovealike and none less dear than thine and my goodMarcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for theircountry than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.Enter a GentlewomanGentlewomanMadam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.VIRGILIABeseech you, give me leave to retire myself.VOLUMNIAIndeed, you shall not.Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody browWith his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mowOr all or lose his hire.VIRGILIAHis bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!VOLUMNIAAway, you fool! it more becomes a manThan gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelierThan Hector's forehead when it spit forth bloodAt Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,We are fit to bid her welcome.Exit GentlewomanVIRGILIAHeavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!VOLUMNIAHe'll beat Aufidius 'head below his kneeAnd tread upon his neck.Enter VALERIA, with an Usher and GentlewomanVALERIAMy ladies both, good day to you.VOLUMNIASweet madam.VIRGILIAI am glad to see your ladyship.VALERIAHow do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in goodfaith. How does your little son?VIRGILIAI thank your ladyship; well, good madam.VOLUMNIAHe had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, thanlook upon his school-master.VALERIAO' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis avery pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'Wednesday half an hour together: has such aconfirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gildedbutterfly: and when he caught it, he let it goagain; and after it again; and over and over hecomes, and again; catched it again; or whether hisfall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set histeeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammockedit!VOLUMNIAOne on 's father's moods.VALERIAIndeed, la, 'tis a noble child.VIRGILIAA crack, madam.VALERIACome, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you playthe idle husewife with me this afternoon.VIRGILIANo, good madam; I will not out of doors.VALERIANot out of doors!VOLUMNIAShe shall, she shall.VIRGILIAIndeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over thethreshold till my lord return from the wars.VALERIAFie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,you must go visit the good lady that lies in.VIRGILIAI will wish her speedy strength, and visit her withmy prayers; but I cannot go thither.VOLUMNIAWhy, I pray you?VIRGILIA'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.VALERIAYou would be another Penelope: yet, they say, allthe yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fillIthaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambricwere sensible as your finger, that you might leavepricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.VIRGILIANo, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.VALERIAIn truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell youexcellent news of your husband.VIRGILIAO, good madam, there can be none yet.VALERIAVerily, I do not jest with you; there came news fromhim last night.VIRGILIAIndeed, madam?VALERIAIn earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; againstwhom Cominius the general is gone, with one part ofour Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are setdown before their city Corioli; they nothing doubtprevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.VIRGILIAGive me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in everything hereafter.VOLUMNIALet her alone, lady: as she is now, she will butdisease our better mirth.VALERIAIn troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thysolemness out o' door. and go along with us.VIRGILIANo, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wishyou much mirth.VALERIAWell, then, farewell.ExeuntSCENE IV. Before Corioli.Enter, with drum and colours, MARCIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, Captains and Soldiers.

Ladders, ho!Enter the army of the VolscesMARCIUSThey fear us not, but issue forth their city.Now put your shields before your hearts, and fightWith hearts more proof than shields. Advance,brave Titus:They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,And he shall feel mine edge.Alarum.

Mend and charge home,Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foeAnd make my wars on you: look to't: come on;If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,As they us to our trenches followed.Another alarum.

Thou art left, Marcius:A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldierEven to Cato's wish, not fierce and terribleOnly in strokes; but, with thy grim looks andThe thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the worldWere feverous and did tremble.Re-enter MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the enemyFirst SoldierLook, sir.LARTIUSO,'tis Marcius!Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.They fight, and all enter the citySCENE V.

To him!There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, takeConvenient numbers to make good the city;Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will hasteTo help Cominius.LARTIUSWorthy sir, thou bleed'st;Thy exercise hath been too violent forA second course of fight.MARCIUSSir, praise me not;My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:The blood I drop is rather physicalThan dangerous to me: to Aufidius thusI will appear, and fight.LARTIUSNow the fair goddess, Fortune,Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charmsMisguide thy opposers' swords!

Whiles we have struck,By interims and conveying gusts we have heardThe charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!Lead their successes as we wish our own,That both our powers, with smilingfronts encountering,May give you thankful sacrifice.Enter a MessengerThy news?MessengerThe citizens of Corioli have issued,And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:I saw our party to their trenches driven,And then I came away.COMINIUSThough thou speak'st truth,Methinks thou speak'st not well.How long is't since?MessengerAbove an hour, my lord.COMINIUS'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,And bring thy news so late?MessengerSpies of the VolscesHeld me in chase, that I was forced to wheelThree or four miles about, else had I, sir,Half an hour since brought my report.COMINIUSWho's yonder,That does appear as he were flay'd? O godsHe has the stamp of Marcius; and I haveBefore-time seen him thus.MARCIUS[Within] Come I too late?COMINIUSThe shepherd knows not thunder from a tabourMore than I know the sound of Marcius' tongueFrom every meaner man.Enter MARCIUSMARCIUSCome I too late?COMINIUSAy, if you come not in the blood of others,But mantled in your own.MARCIUSO, let me clip yeIn arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heartAs merry as when our nuptial day was done,And tapers burn'd to bedward!COMINIUSFlower of warriors,How is it with Titus Lartius?MARCIUSAs with a man busied about decrees:Condemning some to death, and some to exile;Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,To let him slip at will.COMINIUSWhere is that slaveWhich told me they had beat you to your trenches?Where is he? call him hither.MARCIUSLet him alone;He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budgeFrom rascals worse than they.COMINIUSBut how prevail'd you?MARCIUSWill the time serve to tell? I do not think.Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?If not, why cease you till you are so?COMINIUSMarcius,We have at disadvantage fought and didRetire to win our purpose.MARCIUSHow lies their battle? know you on which sideThey have placed their men of trust?COMINIUSAs I guess, Marcius,Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,Their very heart of hope.MARCIUSI do beseech you,By all the battles wherein we have fought,By the blood we have shed together, by the vowsWe have made to endure friends, that you directlySet me against Aufidius and his Antiates;And that you not delay the present, but,Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,We prove this very hour.COMINIUSThough I could wishYou were conducted to a gentle bathAnd balms applied to, you, yet dare I neverDeny your asking: take your choice of thoseThat best can aid your action.MARCIUSThose are theyThat most are willing. If any such be here--As it were sin to doubt--that love this paintingWherein you see me smear'd; if any fearLesser his person than an ill report;If any think brave death outweighs bad lifeAnd that his country's dearer than himself;Let him alone, or so many so minded,Wave thus, to express his disposition,And follow Marcius.They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in their arms, and cast up their capsO, me alone! make you a sword of me?If these shows be not outward, which of youBut is four Volsces? none of you but isAble to bear against the great AufidiusA shield as hard as his. A certain number,Though thanks to all, must I selectfrom all: the restShall bear the business in some other fight,As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;And four shall quickly draw out my command,Which men are best inclined.COMINIUSMarch on, my fellows:Make good this ostentation, and you shallDivide in all with us.ExeuntSCENE VII. The gates of Corioli.TITUS LARTIUS, having set a guard upon Corioli, going with drum and trumpet toward COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS, enters with Lieutenant, other Soldiers, and a ScoutLARTIUSSo, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatchThose centuries to our aid: the rest will serveFor a short holding: if we lose the field,We cannot keep the town.LieutenantFear not our care, sir.LARTIUSHence, and shut your gates upon's.Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.ExeuntSCENE VIII. A field of battle.Alarum as in battle. Enter, from opposite sides, MARCIUS and AUFIDIUSMARCIUSI'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate theeWorse than a promise-breaker.AUFIDIUSWe hate alike:Not Afric owns a serpent I abhorMore than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.MARCIUSLet the first budger die the other's slave,And the gods doom him after!AUFIDIUSIf I fly, Marcius,Holloa me like a hare.MARCIUSWithin these three hours, Tullus,Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my bloodWherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revengeWrench up thy power to the highest.AUFIDIUSWert thou the HectorThat was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,Thou shouldst not scape me here.They fight, and certain Volsces come to the aid of AUFIDIUS. MARCIUS fights till they be driven in breathlessOfficious, and not valiant, you have shamed meIn your condemned seconds.ExeuntSCENE IX. The Roman camp.Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Flourish. Enter, from one side, COMINIUS with the Romans; from the other side, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarfCOMINIUSIf I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report itWhere senators shall mingle tears with smiles,Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,And, gladly quaked, hear more; where thedull tribunes,That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the godsOur Rome hath such a soldier.'Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,Having fully dined before.Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power, from the pursuitLARTIUSO general,Here is the steed, we the caparison:Hadst thou beheld--MARCIUSPray now, no more: my mother,Who has a charter to extol her blood,When she does praise me grieves me. I have doneAs you have done; that's what I can; inducedAs you have been; that's for my country:He that has but effected his good willHath overta'en mine act.COMINIUSYou shall not beThe grave of your deserving; Rome must knowThe value of her own: 'twere a concealmentWorse than a theft, no less than a traducement,To hide your doings; and to silence that,Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech youIn sign of what you are, not to rewardWhat you have done--before our army hear me.MARCIUSI have some wounds upon me, and they smartTo hear themselves remember'd.COMINIUSShould they not,Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of allThe treasure in this field achieved and city,We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,Before the common distribution, atYour only choice.MARCIUSI thank you, general;But cannot make my heart consent to takeA bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;And stand upon my common part with thoseThat have beheld the doing.A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius! Marcius!' cast up their caps and lances: COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bareMARCIUSMay these same instruments, which you profane,Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shallI' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities beMade all of false-faced soothing!When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,Let him be made a coverture for the wars!No more, I say! For that I have not wash'dMy nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--Which, without note, here's many else have done,--You shout me forthIn acclamations hyperbolical;As if I loved my little should be dietedIn praises sauced with lies.COMINIUSToo modest are you;More cruel to your good report than gratefulTo us that give you truly: by your patience,If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,As to us, to all the world, that Caius MarciusWears this war's garland: in token of the which,My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,With all his trim belonging; and from this time,For what he did before Corioli, call him,With all the applause and clamour of the host,CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! BearThe addition nobly ever!Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drumsAllCaius Marcius Coriolanus!CORIOLANUSI will go wash;And when my face is fair, you shall perceiveWhether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.I mean to stride your steed, and at all timesTo undercrest your good additionTo the fairness of my power.COMINIUSSo, to our tent;Where, ere we do repose us, we will writeTo Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,Must to Corioli back: send us to RomeThe best, with whom we may articulate,For their own good and ours.LARTIUSI shall, my lord.CORIOLANUSThe gods begin to mock me. I, that nowRefused most princely gifts, am bound to begOf my lord general.COMINIUSTake't; 'tis yours. What is't?CORIOLANUSI sometime lay here in CorioliAt a poor man's house; he used me kindly:He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;But then Aufidius was with in my view,And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request youTo give my poor host freedom.COMINIUSO, well begg'd!Were he the butcher of my son, he shouldBe free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.LARTIUSMarcius, his name?CORIOLANUSBy Jupiter! forgot.I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.Have we no wine here?COMINIUSGo we to our tent:The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis timeIt should be look'd to: come.ExeuntSCENE X.

Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, bloody, with two or three SoldiersAUFIDIUSThe town is ta'en!First Soldier'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.AUFIDIUSCondition!I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!What good condition can a treaty findI' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounterAs often as we eat. By the elements,If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,He's mine, or I am his: mine emulationHath not that honour in't it had; for whereI thought to crush him in an equal force,True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some wayOr wrath or craft may get him.First SoldierHe's the devil.AUFIDIUSBolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'dWith only suffering stain by him; for himShall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,Embarquements all of fury, shall lift upTheir rotten privilege and custom 'gainstMy hate to Marcius: where I find him, were itAt home, upon my brother's guard, even there,Against the hospitable canon, would IWash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that mustBe hostages for Rome.First SoldierWill not you go?AUFIDIUSI am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thitherHow the world goes, that to the pace of itI may spur on my journey.First SoldierI shall, sir.ExeuntACT IISCENE I. Rome. A public place.Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people, SICINIUS and BRUTUS.MENENIUSThe augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.BRUTUSGood or bad?MENENIUSNot according to the prayer of the people, for theylove not Marcius.SICINIUSNature teaches beasts to know their friends.MENENIUSPray you, who does the wolf love?SICINIUSThe lamb.MENENIUSAy, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would thenoble Marcius.BRUTUSHe's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.MENENIUSHe's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You twoare old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.BothWell, sir.MENENIUSIn what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you twohave not in abundance?BRUTUSHe's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.SICINIUSEspecially in pride.BRUTUSAnd topping all others in boasting.MENENIUSThis is strange now: do you two know how you arecensured here in the city, I mean of us o' theright-hand file? do you?BothWhy, how are we censured?MENENIUSBecause you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?BothWell, well, sir, well.MENENIUSWhy, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief ofoccasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:give your dispositions the reins, and be angry atyour pleasures; at the least if you take it as apleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius forbeing proud?BRUTUSWe do it not alone, sir.MENENIUSI know you can do very little alone; for your helpsare many, or else your actions would grow wondroussingle: your abilities are too infant-like fordoing much alone. You talk of pride: O that youcould turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,and make but an interior survey of your good selves!O that you could!BRUTUSWhat then, sir?MENENIUSWhy, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, asany in Rome.SICINIUSMenenius, you are known well enough too.MENENIUSI am known to be a humorous patrician, and one thatloves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allayingTiber in't; said to be something imperfect infavouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-likeupon too trivial motion; one that converses morewith the buttock of the night than with the foreheadof the morning: what I think I utter, and spend mymalice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen asyou are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drinkyou give me touch my palate adversely, I make acrooked face at it. I can't say your worships havedelivered the matter well, when I find the ass incompound with the major part of your syllables: andthough I must be content to bear with those that sayyou are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly thattell you you have good faces. If you see this inthe map of my microcosm, follows it that I am knownwell enough too? what barm can your bissonconspectuities glean out of this character, if I beknown well enough too?BRUTUSCome, sir, come, we know you well enough.MENENIUSYou know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. Youare ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: youwear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing acause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to asecond day of audience. When you are hearing amatter between party and party, if you chance to bepinched with the colic, you make faces likemummers; set up the bloody flag against allpatience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangledby your hearing: all the peace you make in theircause is, calling both the parties knaves. You area pair of strange ones.BRUTUSCome, come, you are well understood to be aperfecter giber for the table than a necessarybencher in the Capitol.MENENIUSOur very priests must become mockers, if they shallencounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. Whenyou speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth thewagging of your beards; and your beards deserve notso honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher'scushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessorssince Deucalion, though peradventure some of thebest of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den toyour worships: more of your conversation wouldinfect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastlyplebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.BRUTUS and SICINIUS go asideEnter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIAHow now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you followyour eyes so fast?VOLUMNIAHonourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; forthe love of Juno, let's go.MENENIUSHa! Marcius coming home!VOLUMNIAAy, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperousapprobation.MENENIUSTake my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!Marcius coming home!VOLUMNIA VIRGILIANay,'tis true.VOLUMNIALook, here's a letter from him: the state hathanother, his wife another; and, I think, there's oneat home for you.MENENIUSI will make my very house reel tonight: a letter forme!VIRGILIAYes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.MENENIUSA letter for me! it gives me an estate of sevenyears' health; in which time I will make a lip atthe physician: the most sovereign prescription inGalen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,of no better report than a horse-drench. Is henot wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.VIRGILIAO, no, no, no.VOLUMNIAO, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.MENENIUSSo do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.VOLUMNIAOn's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time homewith the oaken garland.MENENIUSHas he disciplined Aufidius soundly?VOLUMNIATitus Lartius writes, they fought together, butAufidius got off.MENENIUSAnd 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:an he had stayed by him, I would not have been sofidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the goldthat's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?VOLUMNIAGood ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senatehas letters from the general, wherein he gives myson the whole name of the war: he hath in thisaction outdone his former deeds doublyVALERIAIn troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.MENENIUSWondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without histrue purchasing.VIRGILIAThe gods grant them true!VOLUMNIATrue! pow, wow.MENENIUSTrue! I'll be sworn they are true.Where is he wounded?To the TribunesGod save your good worships! Marcius is cominghome: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?VOLUMNIAI' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will belarge cicatrices to show the people, when he shallstand for his place. He received in the repulse ofTarquin seven hurts i' the body.MENENIUSOne i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there'snine that I know.VOLUMNIAHe had, before this last expedition, twenty-fivewounds upon him.MENENIUSNow it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.A shout and flourishHark! the trumpets.VOLUMNIAThese are the ushers of Marcius: before him hecarries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the general, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them, CORIOLANUS, crowned with an oaken garland; with Captains and Soldiers, and a HeraldHeraldKnow, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fightWithin Corioli gates: where he hath won,With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; theseIn honour follows Coriolanus.Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!FlourishAllWelcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!CORIOLANUSNo more of this; it does offend my heart:Pray now, no more.COMINIUSLook, sir, your mother!CORIOLANUSO,You have, I know, petition'd all the godsFor my prosperity!KneelsVOLUMNIANay, my good soldier, up;My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, andBy deed-achieving honour newly named,--What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--But O, thy wife!CORIOLANUSMy gracious silence, hail!Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,And mothers that lack sons.MENENIUSNow, the gods crown thee!CORIOLANUSAnd live you yet?To VALERIAO my sweet lady, pardon.VOLUMNIAI know not where to turn: O, welcome home:And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.MENENIUSA hundred thousand welcomes. I could weepAnd I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.A curse begin at very root on's heart,That is not glad to see thee! You are threeThat Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,We have some old crab-trees hereat home that will notBe grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:We call a nettle but a nettle andThe faults of fools but folly.COMINIUSEver right.CORIOLANUSMenenius ever, ever.HeraldGive way there, and go on!CORIOLANUS[To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA] Your hand, and yours:Ere in our own house I do shade my head,The good patricians must be visited;From whom I have received not only greetings,But with them change of honours.VOLUMNIAI have livedTo see inherited my very wishesAnd the buildings of my fancy: onlyThere's one thing wanting, which I doubt not butOur Rome will cast upon thee.CORIOLANUSKnow, good mother,I had rather be their servant in my way,Than sway with them in theirs.COMINIUSOn, to the Capitol!Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before. BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forwardBRUTUSAll tongues speak of him, and the bleared sightsAre spectacled to see him: your prattling nurseInto a rapture lets her baby cryWhile she chats him: the kitchen malkin pinsHer richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsedWith variable complexions, all agreeingIn earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamensDo press among the popular throngs and puffTo win a vulgar station: or veil'd damesCommit the war of white and damask inTheir nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoilOf Phoebus' burning kisses: such a potherAs if that whatsoever god who leads himWere slily crept into his human powersAnd gave him graceful posture.SICINIUSOn the sudden,I warrant him consul.BRUTUSThen our office may,During his power, go sleep.SICINIUSHe cannot temperately transport his honoursFrom where he should begin and end, but willLose those he hath won.BRUTUSIn that there's comfort.SICINIUSDoubt notThe commoners, for whom we stand, but theyUpon their ancient malice will forgetWith the least cause these his new honours, whichThat he will give them make I as little questionAs he is proud to do't.BRUTUSI heard him swear,Were he to stand for consul, never would heAppear i' the market-place nor on him putThe napless vesture of humility;Nor showing, as the manner is, his woundsTo the people, beg their stinking breaths.SICINIUS'Tis right.BRUTUSIt was his word: O, he would miss it ratherThan carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,And the desire of the nobles.SICINIUSI wish no betterThan have him hold that purpose and to put itIn execution.BRUTUS'Tis most like he will.SICINIUSIt shall be to him then as our good wills,A sure destruction.BRUTUSSo it must fall outTo him or our authorities. For an end,We must suggest the people in what hatredHe still hath held them; that to's power he wouldHave made them mules, silenced their pleaders andDispropertied their freedoms, holding them,In human action and capacity,Of no more soul nor fitness for the worldThan camels in the war, who have their provandOnly for bearing burdens, and sore blowsFor sinking under them.SICINIUSThis, as you say, suggestedAt some time when his soaring insolenceShall touch the people--which time shall not want,If he be put upon 't; and that's as easyAs to set dogs on sheep--will be his fireTo kindle their dry stubble; and their blazeShall darken him for ever.Enter a MessengerBRUTUSWhat's the matter?MessengerYou are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thoughtThat Marcius shall be consul:I have seen the dumb men throng to see him andThe blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,As to Jove's statue, and the commons madeA shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:I never saw the like.BRUTUSLet's to the Capitol;And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,But hearts for the event.SICINIUSHave with you.ExeuntSCENE II. The same. The Capitol.Enter two Officers, to lay cushionsFirst OfficerCome, come, they are almost here. How many standfor consulships?Second OfficerThree, they say: but 'tis thought of every oneCoriolanus will carry it.First OfficerThat's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, andloves not the common people.Second OfficerFaith, there had been many great men that haveflattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and therebe many that they have loved, they know notwherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, forCoriolanus neither to care whether they love or hatehim manifests the true knowledge he has in theirdisposition; and out of his noble carelessness letsthem plainly see't.First OfficerIf he did not care whether he had their love or no,he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neithergood nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greaterdevotion than can render it him; and leavesnothing undone that may fully discover him theiropposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice anddispleasure of the people is as bad as that which hedislikes, to flatter them for their love.Second OfficerHe hath deserved worthily of his country: and hisascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,having been supple and courteous to the people,bonneted, without any further deed to have them atan into their estimation and report: but he hath soplanted his honours in their eyes, and his actionsin their hearts, that for their tongues to besilent, and not confess so much, were a kind ofingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were amalice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluckreproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.First OfficerNo more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, theyare coming.A sennet. Enter, with actors before them, COMINIUS the consul, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators, SICINIUS and BRUTUS. The Senators take their places; the Tribunes take their Places by themselves. CORIOLANUS standsMENENIUSHaving determined of the Volsces andTo send for Titus Lartius, it remains,As the main point of this our after-meeting,To gratify his noble service thatHath thus stood for his country: therefore,please you,Most reverend and grave elders, to desireThe present consul, and last generalIn our well-found successes, to reportA little of that worthy work perform'dBy Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whomWe met here both to thank and to rememberWith honours like himself.First SenatorSpeak, good Cominius:Leave nothing out for length, and make us thinkRather our state's defective for requitalThan we to stretch it out.To the TribunesMasters o' the people,We do request your kindest ears, and after,Your loving motion toward the common body,To yield what passes here.SICINIUSWe are conventedUpon a pleasing treaty, and have heartsInclinable to honour and advanceThe theme of our assembly.BRUTUSWhich the ratherWe shall be blest to do, if he rememberA kinder value of the people thanHe hath hereto prized them at.MENENIUSThat's off, that's off;I would you rather had been silent. Please youTo hear Cominius speak?BRUTUSMost willingly;But yet my caution was more pertinentThan the rebuke you give it.MENENIUSHe loves your peopleBut tie him not to be their bedfellow.Worthy Cominius, speak.CORIOLANUS offers to go awayNay, keep your place.First SenatorSit, Coriolanus; never shame to hearWhat you have nobly done.CORIOLANUSYour horror's pardon:I had rather have my wounds to heal againThan hear say how I got them.BRUTUSSir, I hopeMy words disbench'd you not.CORIOLANUSNo, sir: yet oft,When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.You soothed not, therefore hurt not: butyour people,I love them as they weigh.MENENIUSPray now, sit down.CORIOLANUSI had rather have one scratch my head i' the sunWhen the alarum were struck than idly sitTo hear my nothings monster'd.ExitMENENIUSMasters of the people,Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--That's thousand to one good one--when you now seeHe had rather venture all his limbs for honourThan one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.COMINIUSI shall lack voice: the deeds of CoriolanusShould not be utter'd feebly. It is heldThat valour is the chiefest virtue, andMost dignifies the haver: if it be,The man I speak of cannot in the worldBe singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he foughtBeyond the mark of others: our then dictator,Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,When with his Amazonian chin he droveThe bristled lips before him: be bestridAn o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's viewSlew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,When he might act the woman in the scene,He proved best man i' the field, and for his meedWas brow-bound with the oak. His pupil ageMan-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,And in the brunt of seventeen battles sinceHe lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,Before and in Corioli, let me say,I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;And by his rare example made the cowardTurn terror into sport: as weeds beforeA vessel under sail, so men obey'dAnd fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,Where it did mark, it took; from face to footHe was a thing of blood, whose every motionWas timed with dying cries: alone he enter'dThe mortal gate of the city, which he paintedWith shunless destiny; aidless came off,And with a sudden reinforcement struckCorioli like a planet: now all's his:When, by and by, the din of war gan pierceHis ready sense; then straight his doubled spiritRe-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,And to the battle came he; where he didRun reeking o'er the lives of men, as if'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'dBoth field and city ours, he never stoodTo ease his breast with panting.MENENIUSWorthy man!First SenatorHe cannot but with measure fit the honoursWhich we devise him.COMINIUSOur spoils he kick'd at,And look'd upon things precious as they wereThe common muck of the world: he covets lessThan misery itself would give; rewardsHis deeds with doing them, and is contentTo spend the time to end it.MENENIUSHe's right noble:Let him be call'd for.First SenatorCall Coriolanus.OfficerHe doth appear.Re-enter CORIOLANUSMENENIUSThe senate, Coriolanus, are well pleasedTo make thee consul.CORIOLANUSI do owe them stillMy life and services.MENENIUSIt then remainsThat you do speak to the people.CORIOLANUSI do beseech you,Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannotPut on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please youThat I may pass this doing.SICINIUSSir, the peopleMust have their voices; neither will they bateOne jot of ceremony.MENENIUSPut them not to't:Pray you, go fit you to the custom andTake to you, as your predecessors have,Your honour with your form.CORIOLANUSIt is apartThat I shall blush in acting, and might wellBe taken from the people.BRUTUSMark you that?CORIOLANUSTo brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,As if I had received them for the hireOf their breath only!MENENIUSDo not stand upon't.We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,Our purpose to them: and to our noble consulWish we all joy and honour.SenatorsTo Coriolanus come all joy and honour!Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUSBRUTUSYou see how he intends to use the people.SICINIUSMay they perceive's intent! He will require them,As if he did contemn what he requestedShould be in them to give.BRUTUSCome, we'll inform themOf our proceedings here: on the marketplace,I know, they do attend us.ExeuntSCENE III. The same. The Forum.Enter seven or eight CitizensFirst CitizenOnce, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.Second CitizenWe may, sir, if we will.Third CitizenWe have power in ourselves to do it, but it is apower that we have no power to do; for if he show ushis wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put ourtongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, ifhe tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell himour noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude ismonstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,were to make a monster of the multitude: of thewhich we being members, should bring ourselves to bemonstrous members.First CitizenAnd to make us no better thought of, a little helpwill serve; for once we stood up about the corn, hehimself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.Third CitizenWe have been called so of many; not that our headsare some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,but that our wits are so diversely coloured: andtruly I think if all our wits were to issue out ofone skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,and their consent of one direct way should be atonce to all the points o' the compass.Second CitizenThink you so? Which way do you judge my wit wouldfly?Third CitizenNay, your wit will not so soon out as another man'swill;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, butif it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.Second CitizenWhy that way?Third CitizenTo lose itself in a fog, where being three partsmelted away with rotten dews, the fourth would returnfor conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.Second CitizenYou are never without your tricks: you may, you may.Third CitizenAre you all resolved to give your voices? Butthat's no matter, the greater part carries it. Isay, if he would incline to the people, there wasnever a worthier man.Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility, with MENENIUSHere he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark hisbehavior. We are not to stay all together, but tocome by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, andby threes. He's to make his requests byparticulars; wherein every one of us has a singlehonour, in giving him our own voices with our owntongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you howyou shall go by him.AllContent, content.Exeunt CitizensMENENIUSO sir, you are not right: have you not knownThe worthiest men have done't?CORIOLANUSWhat must I say?'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bringMy tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!I got them in my country's service, whenSome certain of your brethren roar'd and ranFrom the noise of our own drums.'MENENIUSO me, the gods!You must not speak of that: you must desire themTo think upon you.CORIOLANUSThink upon me! hang 'em!I would they would forget me, like the virtuesWhich our divines lose by 'em.MENENIUSYou'll mar all:I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,In wholesome manner.ExitCORIOLANUSBid them wash their facesAnd keep their teeth clean.Re-enter two of the CitizensSo, here comes a brace.Re-enter a third CitizenYou know the cause, air, of my standing here.Third CitizenWe do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.CORIOLANUSMine own desert.Second CitizenYour own desert!CORIOLANUSAy, but not mine own desire.Third CitizenHow not your own desire?CORIOLANUSNo, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble thepoor with begging.Third CitizenYou must think, if we give you any thing, we hope togain by you.CORIOLANUSWell then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?First CitizenThe price is to ask it kindly.CORIOLANUSKindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds toshow you, which shall be yours in private. Yourgood voice, sir; what say you?Second CitizenYou shall ha' it, worthy sir.CORIOLANUSA match, sir. There's in all two worthy voicesbegged. I have your alms: adieu.Third CitizenBut this is something odd.Second CitizenAn 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.Exeunt the three CitizensRe-enter two other CitizensCORIOLANUSPray you now, if it may stand with the tune of yourvoices that I may be consul, I have here thecustomary gown.Fourth CitizenYou have deserved nobly of your country, and youhave not deserved nobly.CORIOLANUSYour enigma?Fourth CitizenYou have been a scourge to her enemies, you havebeen a rod to her friends; you have not indeed lovedthe common people.CORIOLANUSYou should account me the more virtuous that I havenot been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter mysworn brother, the people, to earn a dearerestimation of them; 'tis a condition they accountgentle: and since the wisdom of their choice israther to have my hat than my heart, I will practisethe insinuating nod and be off to them mostcounterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit thebewitchment of some popular man and give itbountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,I may be consul.Fifth CitizenWe hope to find you our friend; and therefore giveyou our voices heartily.Fourth CitizenYou have received many wounds for your country.CORIOLANUSI will not seal your knowledge with showing them. Iwill make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.Both CitizensThe gods give you joy, sir, heartily!ExeuntCORIOLANUSMost sweet voices!Better it is to die, better to starve,Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:What custom wills, in all things should we do't,The dust on antique time would lie unswept,And mountainous error be too highly heaptFor truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,Let the high office and the honour goTo one that would do thus. I am half through;The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.Re-enter three Citizens moreHere come more voices.Your voices: for your voices I have fought;Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bearOf wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice sixI have seen and heard of; for your voices haveDone many things, some less, some more your voices:Indeed I would be consul.Sixth CitizenHe has done nobly, and cannot go without any honestman's voice.Seventh CitizenTherefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,and make him good friend to the people!All CitizensAmen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!ExeuntCORIOLANUSWorthy voices!Re-enter MENENIUS, with BRUTUS and SICINIUSMENENIUSYou have stood your limitation; and the tribunesEndue you with the people's voice: remainsThat, in the official marks invested, youAnon do meet the senate.CORIOLANUSIs this done?SICINIUSThe custom of request you have discharged:The people do admit you, and are summon'dTo meet anon, upon your approbation.CORIOLANUSWhere? at the senate-house?SICINIUSThere, Coriolanus.CORIOLANUSMay I change these garments?SICINIUSYou may, sir.CORIOLANUSThat I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,Repair to the senate-house.MENENIUSI'll keep you company. Will you along?BRUTUSWe stay here for the people.SICINIUSFare you well.Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUSHe has it now, and by his looks methink'Tis warm at 's heart.BRUTUSWith a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.will you dismiss the people?Re-enter CitizensSICINIUSHow now, my masters! have you chose this man?First CitizenHe has our voices, sir.BRUTUSWe pray the gods he may deserve your loves.Second CitizenAmen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.Third CitizenCertainlyHe flouted us downright.First CitizenNo,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.Second CitizenNot one amongst us, save yourself, but saysHe used us scornfully: he should have show'd usHis marks of merit, wounds received for's country.SICINIUSWhy, so he did, I am sure.CitizensNo, no; no man saw 'em.Third CitizenHe said he had wounds, which he could showin private;And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,But by your voices, will not so permit me;Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:Your most sweet voices: now you have leftyour voices,I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?SICINIUSWhy either were you ignorant to see't,Or, seeing it, of such childish friendlinessTo yield your voices?BRUTUSCould you not have told himAs you were lesson'd, when he had no power,But was a petty servant to the state,He was your enemy, ever spake againstYour liberties and the charters that you bearI' the body of the weal; and now, arrivingA place of potency and sway o' the state,If he should still malignantly remainFast foe to the plebeii, your voices mightBe curses to yourselves? You should have saidThat as his worthy deeds did claim no lessThan what he stood for, so his gracious natureWould think upon you for your voices andTranslate his malice towards you into love,Standing your friendly lord.SICINIUSThus to have said,As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spiritAnd tried his inclination; from him pluck'dEither his gracious promise, which you might,As cause had call'd you up, have held him toOr else it would have gall'd his surly nature,Which easily endures not articleTying him to aught; so putting him to rage,You should have ta'en the advantage of his cholerAnd pass'd him unelected.BRUTUSDid you perceiveHe did solicit you in free contemptWhen he did need your loves, and do you thinkThat his contempt shall not be bruising to you,When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodiesNo heart among you? or had you tongues to cryAgainst the rectorship of judgment?SICINIUSHave youEre now denied the asker? and now againOf him that did not ask, but mock, bestowYour sued-for tongues?Third CitizenHe's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.Second CitizenAnd will deny him:I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.First CitizenI twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.BRUTUSGet you hence instantly, and tell those friends,They have chose a consul that will from them takeTheir liberties; make them of no more voiceThan dogs that are as often beat for barkingAs therefore kept to do so.SICINIUSLet them assemble,And on a safer judgment all revokeYour ignorant election; enforce his pride,And his old hate unto you; besides, forget notWith what contempt he wore the humble weed,How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,Thinking upon his services, took from youThe apprehension of his present portance,Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashionAfter the inveterate hate he bears you.BRUTUSLayA fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,No impediment between, but that you mustCast your election on him.SICINIUSSay, you chose himMore after our commandment than as guidedBy your own true affections, and that your minds,Preoccupied with what you rather must doThan what you should, made you against the grainTo voice him consul: lay the fault on us.BRUTUSAy, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.How youngly he began to serve his country,How long continued, and what stock he springs of,The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence cameThat Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,That our beat water brought by conduits hither;And [Censorinus,] nobly named so,Twice being [by the people chosen] censor,Was his great ancestor.SICINIUSOne thus descended,That hath beside well in his person wroughtTo be set high in place, we did commendTo your remembrances: but you have found,Scaling his present bearing with his past,That he's your fixed enemy, and revokeYour sudden approbation.BRUTUSSay, you ne'er had done't--Harp on that still--but by our putting on;And presently, when you have drawn your number,Repair to the Capitol.AllWe will so: almost allRepent in their election.Exeunt CitizensBRUTUSLet them go on;This mutiny were better put in hazard,Than stay, past doubt, for greater:If, as his nature is, he fall in rageWith their refusal, both observe and answerThe vantage of his anger.SICINIUSTo the Capitol, come:We will be there before the stream o' the people;And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,Which we have goaded onward.ExeuntACT IIISCENE I.

Welcome home.Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUSBehold, these are the tribunes of the people,The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;For they do prank them in authority,Against all noble sufferance.SICINIUSPass no further.CORIOLANUSHa! what is that?BRUTUSIt will be dangerous to go on: no further.CORIOLANUSWhat makes this change?MENENIUSThe matter?COMINIUSHath he not pass'd the noble and the common?BRUTUSCominius, no.CORIOLANUSHave I had children's voices?First SenatorTribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.BRUTUSThe people are incensed against him.SICINIUSStop,Or all will fall in broil.CORIOLANUSAre these your herd?Must these have voices, that can yield them nowAnd straight disclaim their tongues? What areyour offices?You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?Have you not set them on?MENENIUSBe calm, be calm.CORIOLANUSIt is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,To curb the will of the nobility:Suffer't, and live with such as cannot ruleNor ever will be ruled.BRUTUSCall't not a plot:The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,When corn was given them gratis, you repined;Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd themTime-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.CORIOLANUSWhy, this was known before.BRUTUSNot to them all.CORIOLANUSHave you inform'd them sithence?BRUTUSHow! I inform them!CORIOLANUSYou are like to do such business.BRUTUSNot unlike,Each way, to better yours.CORIOLANUSWhy then should I be consul? By yond clouds,Let me deserve so ill as you, and make meYour fellow tribune.SICINIUSYou show too much of thatFor which the people stir: if you will passTo where you are bound, you must inquire your way,Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,Or never be so noble as a consul,Nor yoke with him for tribune.MENENIUSLet's be calm.COMINIUSThe people are abused; set on. This palteringBecomes not Rome, nor has CoriolanusDeserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falselyI' the plain way of his merit.CORIOLANUSTell me of corn!This was my speech, and I will speak't again--MENENIUSNot now, not now.First SenatorNot in this heat, sir, now.CORIOLANUSNow, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,I crave their pardons:For the mutable, rank-scented many, let themRegard me as I do not flatter, andTherein behold themselves: I say again,In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senateThe cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,and scatter'd,By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but thatWhich they have given to beggars.MENENIUSWell, no more.First SenatorNo more words, we beseech you.CORIOLANUSHow! no more!As for my country I have shed my blood,Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungsCoin words till their decay against those measles,Which we disdain should tatter us, yet soughtThe very way to catch them.BRUTUSYou speak o' the people,As if you were a god to punish, notA man of their infirmity.SICINIUS'Twere wellWe let the people know't.MENENIUSWhat, what? his choler?CORIOLANUSCholer!Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,By Jove, 'twould be my mind!SICINIUSIt is a mindThat shall remain a poison where it is,Not poison any further.CORIOLANUSShall remain!Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark youHis absolute 'shall'?COMINIUS'Twas from the canon.CORIOLANUS'Shall'!O good but most unwise patricians! why,You grave but reckless senators, have you thusGiven Hydra here to choose an officer,That with his peremptory 'shall,' being butThe horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spiritTo say he'll turn your current in a ditch,And make your channel his? If he have powerThen vail your ignorance; if none, awakeYour dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,Be not as common fools; if you are not,Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,If they be senators: and they are no less,When, both your voices blended, the great'st tasteMost palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'His popular 'shall' against a graver benchThan ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!It makes the consuls base: and my soul achesTo know, when two authorities are up,Neither supreme, how soon confusionMay enter 'twixt the gap of both and takeThe one by the other.COMINIUSWell, on to the market-place.CORIOLANUSWhoever gave that counsel, to give forthThe corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas usedSometime in Greece,--MENENIUSWell, well, no more of that.CORIOLANUSThough there the people had more absolute power,I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fedThe ruin of the state.BRUTUSWhy, shall the people giveOne that speaks thus their voice?CORIOLANUSI'll give my reasons,More worthier than their voices. They know the cornWas not our recompense, resting well assuredThat ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,They would not thread the gates. This kind of serviceDid not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the warTheir mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'dMost valour, spoke not for them: the accusationWhich they have often made against the senate,All cause unborn, could never be the motiveOf our so frank donation. Well, what then?How shall this bisson multitude digestThe senate's courtesy? Let deeds expressWhat's like to be their words: 'we did request it;We are the greater poll, and in true fearThey gave us our demands.' Thus we debaseThe nature of our seats and make the rabbleCall our cares fears; which will in timeBreak ope the locks o' the senate and bring inThe crows to peck the eagles.MENENIUSCome, enough.BRUTUSEnough, with over-measure.CORIOLANUSNo, take more:What may be sworn by, both divine and human,Seal what I end withal! This double worship,Where one part does disdain with cause, the otherInsult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,Cannot conclude but by the yea and noOf general ignorance,--it must omitReal necessities, and give way the whileTo unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,it follows,Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--You that will be less fearful than discreet,That love the fundamental part of stateMore than you doubt the change on't, that preferA noble life before a long, and wishTo jump a body with a dangerous physicThat's sure of death without it, at once pluck outThe multitudinous tongue; let them not lickThe sweet which is their poison: your dishonourMangles true judgment and bereaves the stateOf that integrity which should become't,Not having the power to do the good it would,For the in which doth control't.BRUTUSHas said enough.SICINIUSHas spoken like a traitor, and shall answerAs traitors do.CORIOLANUSThou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!What should the people do with these bald tribunes?On whom depending, their obedience failsTo the greater bench: in a rebellion,When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,Then were they chosen: in a better hour,Let what is meet be said it must be meet,And throw their power i' the dust.BRUTUSManifest treason!SICINIUSThis a consul? no.BRUTUSThe aediles, ho!Enter an AEdileLet him be apprehended.SICINIUSGo, call the people:Exit AEdilein whose name myselfAttach thee as a traitorous innovator,A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,And follow to thine answer.CORIOLANUSHence, old goat!Senators, & C We'll surety him.COMINIUSAged sir, hands off.CORIOLANUSHence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bonesOut of thy garments.SICINIUSHelp, ye citizens!Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with the AEdilesMENENIUSOn both sides more respect.SICINIUSHere's he that would take from you all your power.BRUTUSSeize him, AEdiles!CitizensDown with him! down with him!Senators, & C Weapons, weapons, weapons!They all bustle about CORIOLANUS, crying'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!''Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!''Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'MENENIUSWhat is about to be? I am out of breath;Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunesTo the people! Coriolanus, patience!Speak, good Sicinius.SICINIUSHear me, people; peace!CitizensLet's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.SICINIUSYou are at point to lose your liberties:Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,Whom late you have named for consul.MENENIUSFie, fie, fie!This is the way to kindle, not to quench.First SenatorTo unbuild the city and to lay all flat.SICINIUSWhat is the city but the people?CitizensTrue,The people are the city.BRUTUSBy the consent of all, we were establish'dThe people's magistrates.CitizensYou so remain.MENENIUSAnd so are like to do.COMINIUSThat is the way to lay the city flat;To bring the roof to the foundation,And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,In heaps and piles of ruin.SICINIUSThis deserves death.BRUTUSOr let us stand to our authority,Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,Upon the part o' the people, in whose powerWe were elected theirs, Marcius is worthyOf present death.SICINIUSTherefore lay hold of him;Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thenceInto destruction cast him.BRUTUSAEdiles, seize him!CitizensYield, Marcius, yield!MENENIUSHear me one word;Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.AEdilePeace, peace!MENENIUS[To BRUTUS] Be that you seem, truly yourcountry's friend,And temperately proceed to what you wouldThus violently redress.BRUTUSSir, those cold ways,That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonousWhere the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,And bear him to the rock.CORIOLANUSNo, I'll die here.Drawing his swordThere's some among you have beheld me fighting:Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.MENENIUSDown with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.BRUTUSLay hands upon him.COMINIUSHelp Marcius, help,You that be noble; help him, young and old!CitizensDown with him, down with him!In this mutiny, the Tribunes, the AEdiles, and the People, are beat inMENENIUSGo, get you to your house; be gone, away!All will be naught else.Second SenatorGet you gone.COMINIUSStand fast;We have as many friends as enemies.MENENIUSSham it be put to that?First SenatorThe gods forbid!I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;Leave us to cure this cause.MENENIUSFor 'tis a sore upon us,You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.COMINIUSCome, sir, along with us.CORIOLANUSI would they were barbarians--as they are,Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--MENENIUSBe gone;Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;One time will owe another.CORIOLANUSOn fair groundI could beat forty of them.COMINIUSI could myselfTake up a brace o' the best of them; yea, thetwo tribunes:But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;And manhood is call'd foolery, when it standsAgainst a falling fabric. Will you hence,Before the tag return? whose rage doth rendLike interrupted waters and o'erbearWhat they are used to bear.MENENIUSPray you, be gone:I'll try whether my old wit be in requestWith those that have but little: this must be patch'dWith cloth of any colour.COMINIUSNay, come away.Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, and othersA PatricianThis man has marr'd his fortune.MENENIUSHis nature is too noble for the world:He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;And, being angry, does forget that everHe heard the name of death.A noise withinHere's goodly work!Second PatricianI would they were abed!MENENIUSI would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!Could he not speak 'em fair?Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, with the rabbleSICINIUSWhere is this viperThat would depopulate the city andBe every man himself?MENENIUSYou worthy tribunes,--SICINIUSHe shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rockWith rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,And therefore law shall scorn him further trialThan the severity of the public powerWhich he so sets at nought.First CitizenHe shall well knowThe noble tribunes are the people's mouths,And we their hands.CitizensHe shall, sure on't.MENENIUSSir, sir,--SICINIUSPeace!MENENIUSDo not cry havoc, where you should but huntWith modest warrant.SICINIUSSir, how comes't that youHave holp to make this rescue?MENENIUSHear me speak:As I do know the consul's worthiness,So can I name his faults,--SICINIUSConsul! what consul?MENENIUSThe consul Coriolanus.BRUTUSHe consul!CitizensNo, no, no, no, no.MENENIUSIf, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;The which shall turn you to no further harmThan so much loss of time.SICINIUSSpeak briefly then;For we are peremptory to dispatchThis viperous traitor: to eject him henceWere but one danger, and to keep him hereOur certain death: therefore it is decreedHe dies to-night.MENENIUSNow the good gods forbidThat our renowned Rome, whose gratitudeTowards her deserved children is enroll'dIn Jove's own book, like an unnatural damShould now eat up her own!SICINIUSHe's a disease that must be cut away.MENENIUSO, he's a limb that has but a disease;Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;And what is left, to lose it by his country,Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,A brand to the end o' the world.SICINIUSThis is clean kam.BRUTUSMerely awry: when he did love his country,It honour'd him.MENENIUSThe service of the footBeing once gangrened, is not then respectedFor what before it was.BRUTUSWe'll hear no more.Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:Lest his infection, being of catching nature,Spread further.MENENIUSOne word more, one word.This tiger-footed rage, when it shall findThe harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too lateTie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,And sack great Rome with Romans.BRUTUSIf it were so,--SICINIUSWhat do ye talk?Have we not had a taste of his obedience?Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.MENENIUSConsider this: he has been bred i' the warsSince he could draw a sword, and is ill school'dIn bolted language; meal and bran togetherHe throws without distinction. Give me leave,I'll go to him, and undertake to bring himWhere he shall answer, by a lawful form,In peace, to his utmost peril.First SenatorNoble tribunes,It is the humane way: the other courseWill prove too bloody, and the end of itUnknown to the beginning.SICINIUSNoble Menenius,Be you then as the people's officer.Masters, lay down your weapons.BRUTUSGo not home.SICINIUSMeet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceedIn our first way.MENENIUSI'll bring him to you.To the SenatorsLet me desire your company: he must come,Or what is worst will follow.First SenatorPray you, let's to him.ExeuntSCENE II. A room in CORIOLANUS'S house.Enter CORIOLANUS with PatriciansCORIOLANUSLet them puff all about mine ears, present meDeath on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,That the precipitation might down stretchBelow the beam of sight, yet will I stillBe thus to them.A PatricianYou do the nobler.CORIOLANUSI muse my motherDoes not approve me further, who was wontTo call them woollen vassals, things createdTo buy and sell with groats, to show bare headsIn congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,When one but of my ordinance stood upTo speak of peace or war.Enter VOLUMNIAI talk of you:Why did you wish me milder? would you have meFalse to my nature? Rather say I playThe man I am.VOLUMNIAO, sir, sir, sir,I would have had you put your power well on,Before you had worn it out.CORIOLANUSLet go.VOLUMNIAYou might have been enough the man you are,With striving less to be so; lesser had beenThe thwartings of your dispositions, ifYou had not show'd them how ye were disposedEre they lack'd power to cross you.CORIOLANUSLet them hang.A PatricianAy, and burn too.Enter MENENIUS and SenatorsMENENIUSCome, come, you have been too rough, somethingtoo rough;You must return and mend it.First SenatorThere's no remedy;Unless, by not so doing, our good cityCleave in the midst, and perish.VOLUMNIAPray, be counsell'd:I have a heart as little apt as yours,But yet a brain that leads my use of angerTo better vantage.MENENIUSWell said, noble woman?Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but thatThe violent fit o' the time craves it as physicFor the whole state, I would put mine armour on,Which I can scarcely bear.CORIOLANUSWhat must I do?MENENIUSReturn to the tribunes.CORIOLANUSWell, what then? what then?MENENIUSRepent what you have spoke.CORIOLANUSFor them! I cannot do it to the gods;Must I then do't to them?VOLUMNIAYou are too absolute;Though therein you can never be too noble,But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,In peace what each of them by the other lose,That they combine not there.CORIOLANUSTush, tush!MENENIUSA good demand.VOLUMNIAIf it be honour in your wars to seemThe same you are not, which, for your best ends,You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,That it shall hold companionship in peaceWith honour, as in war, since that to bothIt stands in like request?CORIOLANUSWhy force you this?VOLUMNIABecause that now it lies you on to speakTo the people; not by your own instruction,Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,But with such words that are but rooted inYour tongue, though but bastards and syllablesOf no allowance to your bosom's truth.Now, this no more dishonours you at allThan to take in a town with gentle words,Which else would put you to your fortune andThe hazard of much blood.I would dissemble with my nature whereMy fortunes and my friends at stake requiredI should do so in honour: I am in this,Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;And you will rather show our general loutsHow you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,For the inheritance of their loves and safeguardOf what that want might ruin.MENENIUSNoble lady!Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,Not what is dangerous present, but the lossOf what is past.VOLUMNIAI prithee now, my son,Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such businessAction is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorantMore learned than the ears--waving thy head,Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,Now humble as the ripest mulberryThat will not hold the handling: or say to them,Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broilsHast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frameThyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so farAs thou hast power and person.MENENIUSThis but done,Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;For they have pardons, being ask'd, as freeAs words to little purpose.VOLUMNIAPrithee now,Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst ratherFollow thine enemy in a fiery gulfThan flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.Enter COMINIUSCOMINIUSI have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fitYou make strong party, or defend yourselfBy calmness or by absence: all's in anger.MENENIUSOnly fair speech.COMINIUSI think 'twill serve, if heCan thereto frame his spirit.VOLUMNIAHe must, and willPrithee now, say you will, and go about it.CORIOLANUSMust I go show them my unbarbed sconce?Must I with base tongue give my noble heartA lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind itAnd throw't against the wind. To the market-place!You have put me now to such a part which neverI shall discharge to the life.COMINIUSCome, come, we'll prompt you.VOLUMNIAI prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast saidMy praises made thee first a soldier, so,To have my praise for this, perform a partThou hast not done before.CORIOLANUSWell, I must do't:Away, my disposition, and possess meSome harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,Which quired with my drum, into a pipeSmall as an eunuch, or the virgin voiceThat babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knavesTent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take upThe glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongueMake motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like hisThat hath received an alms! I will not do't,Lest I surcease to honour mine own truthAnd by my body's action teach my mindA most inherent baseness.VOLUMNIAAt thy choice, then:To beg of thee, it is my more dishonourThan thou of them. Come all to ruin; letThy mother rather feel thy pride than fearThy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at deathWith as big heart as thou. Do as thou listThy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,But owe thy pride thyself.CORIOLANUSPray, be content:Mother, I am going to the market-place;Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,Cog their hearts from them, and come home belovedOf all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;Or never trust to what my tongue can doI' the way of flattery further.VOLUMNIADo your will.ExitCOMINIUSAway! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourselfTo answer mildly; for they are preparedWith accusations, as I hear, more strongThan are upon you yet.CORIOLANUSThe word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:Let them accuse me by invention, IWill answer in mine honour.MENENIUSAy, but mildly.CORIOLANUSWell, mildly be it then. Mildly!ExeuntSCENE III. The same.

Farewell, my wife, my mother:I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheldHeart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot wellMy hazards still have been your solace: andBelieve't not lightly--though I go alone,Like to a lonely dragon, that his fenMakes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your sonWill or exceed the common or be caughtWith cautelous baits and practise.VOLUMNIAMy first son.Whither wilt thou go?

I'll tell thee what; yet go:Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my sonWere in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,His good sword in his hand.SICINIUSWhat then?VIRGILIAWhat then!He'ld make an end of thy posterity.VOLUMNIABastards and all.Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!MENENIUSCome, come, peace.SICINIUSI would he had continued to his countryAs he began, and not unknit himselfThe noble knot he made.BRUTUSI would he had.VOLUMNIA'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worthAs I can of those mysteries which heavenWill not have earth to know.BRUTUSPray, let us go.VOLUMNIANow, pray, sir, get you gone:You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--As far as doth the Capitol exceedThe meanest house in Rome, so far my son--This lady's husband here, this, do you see--Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.BRUTUSWell, well, we'll leave you.SICINIUSWhy stay we to be baitedWith one that wants her wits?VOLUMNIATake my prayers with you.Exeunt TribunesI would the gods had nothing else to doBut to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'emBut once a-day, it would unclog my heartOf what lies heavy to't.MENENIUSYou have told them home;And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?VOLUMNIAAnger's my meat; I sup upon myself,And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.MENENIUSFie, fie, fie!ExeuntSCENE III. A highway between Rome and Antium.Enter a Roman and a Volsce, meetingRomanI know you well, sir, and you knowme: your name, I think, is Adrian.VolsceIt is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.RomanI am a Roman; and my services are,as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?VolsceNicanor? no.RomanThe same, sir.VolsceYou had more beard when I last saw you; but yourfavour is well approved by your tongue. What's thenews in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,to find you out there: you have well saved me aday's journey.RomanThere hath been in Rome strange insurrections; thepeople against the senators, patricians, and nobles.VolsceHath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks notso: they are in a most warlike preparation, andhope to come upon them in the heat of their division.RomanThe main blaze of it is past, but a small thingwould make it flame again: for the nobles receiveso to heart the banishment of that worthyCoriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to takeall power from the people and to pluck from themtheir tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I cantell you, and is almost mature for the violentbreaking out.VolsceCoriolanus banished!RomanBanished, sir.VolsceYou will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.RomanThe day serves well for them now. I have heard itsaid, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife iswhen she's fallen out with her husband. Your nobleTullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, hisgreat opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no requestof his country.VolsceHe cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thusaccidentally to encounter you: you have ended mybusiness, and I will merrily accompany you home.RomanI shall, between this and supper, tell you moststrange things from Rome; all tending to the good oftheir adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?VolsceA most royal one; the centurions and their charges,distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,and to be on foot at an hour's warning.RomanI am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am theman, I think, that shall set them in present action.So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.VolsceYou take my part from me, sir; I have the most causeto be glad of yours.RomanWell, let us go together.ExeuntSCENE IV. Antium. Before Aufidius's house.Enter CORIOLANUS in mean apparel, disguised and muffledCORIOLANUSA goodly city is this Antium. City,'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heirOf these fair edifices 'fore my warsHave I heard groan and drop: then know me not,Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stonesIn puny battle slay me.Enter a CitizenSave you, sir.CitizenAnd you.CORIOLANUSDirect me, if it be your will,Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?CitizenHe is, and feasts the nobles of the stateAt his house this night.CORIOLANUSWhich is his house, beseech you?CitizenThis, here before you.CORIOLANUSThank you, sir: farewell.Exit CitizenO world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in loveUnseparable, shall within this hour,On a dissension of a doit, break outTo bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,To take the one the other, by some chance,Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friendsAnd interjoin their issues. So with me:My birth-place hate I, and my love's uponThis enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,He does fair justice; if he give me way,I'll do his country service.ExitSCENE V. The same.

Pray you, avoidthe house.CORIOLANUSLet me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.Third ServingmanWhat are you?CORIOLANUSA gentleman.Third ServingmanA marvellous poor one.CORIOLANUSTrue, so I am.Third ServingmanPray you, poor gentleman, take up some otherstation; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.CORIOLANUSFollow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.Pushes him awayThird ServingmanWhat, you will not?

Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thytrencher, hence!Beats him away. Exit third ServingmanEnter AUFIDIUS with the second ServingmanAUFIDIUSWhere is this fellow?Second ServingmanHere, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but fordisturbing the lords within.RetiresAUFIDIUSWhence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?CORIOLANUSIf, Tullus,UnmufflingNot yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost notThink me for the man I am, necessityCommands me name myself.AUFIDIUSWhat is thy name?CORIOLANUSA name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,And harsh in sound to thine.AUFIDIUSSay, what's thy name?Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy faceBears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?CORIOLANUSPrepare thy brow to frown: know'stthou me yet?AUFIDIUSI know thee not: thy name?CORIOLANUSMy name is Caius Marcius, who hath doneTo thee particularly and to all the VolscesGreat hurt and mischief; thereto witness mayMy surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,The extreme dangers and the drops of bloodShed for my thankless country are requitedBut with that surname; a good memory,And witness of the malice and displeasureWhich thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;The cruelty and envy of the people,Permitted by our dastard nobles, whoHave all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to beWhoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremityHath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--Mistake me not--to save my life, for ifI had fear'd death, of all the men i' the worldI would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,To be full quit of those my banishers,Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hastA heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revengeThine own particular wrongs and stop those maimsOf shame seen through thy country, speedthee straight,And make my misery serve thy turn: so use itThat my revengeful services may proveAs benefits to thee, for I will fightAgainst my canker'd country with the spleenOf all the under fiends. But if so beThou darest not this and that to prove more fortunesThou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also amLonger to live most weary, and presentMy throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,And cannot live but to thy shame, unlessIt be to do thee service.AUFIDIUSO Marcius, Marcius!Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heartA root of ancient envy. If JupiterShould from yond cloud speak divine things,And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them moreThan thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twineMine arms about that body, where againstMy grained ash an hundred times hath brokeAnd scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clipThe anvil of my sword, and do contestAs hotly and as nobly with thy loveAs ever in ambitious strength I didContend against thy valour. Know thou first,I loved the maid I married; never manSigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heartThan when I first my wedded mistress sawBestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,We have a power on foot; and I had purposeOnce more to hew thy target from thy brawn,Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me outTwelve several times, and I have nightly sinceDreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;We have been down together in my sleep,Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but thatThou art thence banish'd, we would muster allFrom twelve to seventy, and pouring warInto the bowels of ungrateful Rome,Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,And take our friendly senators by the hands;Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,Who am prepared against your territories,Though not for Rome itself.CORIOLANUSYou bless me, gods!AUFIDIUSTherefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt haveThe leading of thine own revenges, takeThe one half of my commission; and set down--As best thou art experienced, since thou know'stThy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,Or rudely visit them in parts remote,To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:Let me commend thee first to those that shallSay yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!And more a friend than e'er an enemy;Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two Servingmen come forwardFirst ServingmanHere's a strange alteration!Second ServingmanBy my hand, I had thought to have strucken him witha cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made afalse report of him.First ServingmanWhat an arm he has! he turned me about with hisfinger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.Second ServingmanNay, I knew by his face that there was something inhim: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--Icannot tell how to term it.First ServingmanHe had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,but I thought there was more in him than I could think.Second ServingmanSo did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarestman i' the world.First ServingmanI think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.Second ServingmanWho, my master?First ServingmanNay, it's no matter for that.Second ServingmanWorth six on him.First ServingmanNay, not so neither: but I take him to be thegreater soldier.Second ServingmanFaith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.First ServingmanAy, and for an assault too.Re-enter third ServingmanThird ServingmanO slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!First Servingman Second ServingmanWhat, what, what? let's partake.Third ServingmanI would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had aslieve be a condemned man.First Servingman Second ServingmanWherefore? wherefore?Third ServingmanWhy, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,Caius Marcius.First ServingmanWhy do you say 'thwack our general '?Third ServingmanI do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was alwaysgood enough for him.Second ServingmanCome, we are fellows and friends: he was ever toohard for him; I have heard him say so himself.First ServingmanHe was too hard for him directly, to say the trothon't: before Corioli he scotched him and notchedhim like a carbon ado.Second ServingmanAn he had been cannibally given, he might havebroiled and eaten him too.First ServingmanBut, more of thy news?Third ServingmanWhy, he is so made on here within, as if he were sonand heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; noquestion asked him by any of the senators, but theystand bald before him: our general himself makes amistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand andturns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. Butthe bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'the middle and but one half of what he wasyesterday; for the other has half, by the entreatyand grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: hewill mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.Second ServingmanAnd he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.Third ServingmanDo't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has asmany friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as itwere, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, aswe term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.First ServingmanDirectitude! what's that?Third ServingmanBut when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,and the man in blood, they will out of theirburrows, like conies after rain, and revel all withhim.First ServingmanBut when goes this forward?Third ServingmanTo-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have thedrum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, aparcel of their feast, and to be executed ere theywipe their lips.Second ServingmanWhy, then we shall have a stirring world again.This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increasetailors, and breed ballad-makers.First ServingmanLet me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far asday does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, andfull of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of morebastard children than war's a destroyer of men.Second Servingman'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said tobe a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is agreat maker of cuckolds.First ServingmanAy, and it makes men hate one another.Third ServingmanReason; because they then less need one another.The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheapas Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.AllIn, in, in, in!ExeuntSCENE VI. Rome. A public place.Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUSSICINIUSWe hear not of him, neither need we fear him;His remedies are tame i' the present peaceAnd quietness of the people, which beforeWere in wild hurry. Here do we make his friendsBlush that the world goes well, who rather had,Though they themselves did suffer by't, beholdDissentious numbers pestering streets than seeOur tradesmen with in their shops and goingAbout their functions friendly.BRUTUSWe stood to't in good time.Enter MENENIUSIs this Menenius?SICINIUS'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.Both TribunesHail sir!MENENIUSHail to you both!SICINIUSYour CoriolanusIs not much miss'd, but with his friends:The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,Were he more angry at it.MENENIUSAll's well; and might have been much better, ifHe could have temporized.SICINIUSWhere is he, hear you?MENENIUSNay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wifeHear nothing from him.Enter three or four CitizensCitizensThe gods preserve you both!SICINIUSGod-den, our neighbours.BRUTUSGod-den to you all, god-den to you all.First CitizenOurselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,Are bound to pray for you both.SICINIUSLive, and thrive!BRUTUSFarewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd CoriolanusHad loved you as we did.CitizensNow the gods keep you!Both TribunesFarewell, farewell.Exeunt CitizensSICINIUSThis is a happier and more comely timeThan when these fellows ran about the streets,Crying confusion.BRUTUSCaius Marcius wasA worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,Self-loving,--SICINIUSAnd affecting one sole throne,Without assistance.MENENIUSI think not so.SICINIUSWe should by this, to all our lamentation,If he had gone forth consul, found it so.BRUTUSThe gods have well prevented it, and RomeSits safe and still without him.Enter an AEdileAEdileWorthy tribunes,There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,Reports, the Volsces with two several powersAre enter'd in the Roman territories,And with the deepest malice of the warDestroy what lies before 'em.MENENIUS'Tis Aufidius,Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,And durst not once peep out.SICINIUSCome, what talk youOf Marcius?BRUTUSGo see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot beThe Volsces dare break with us.MENENIUSCannot be!We have record that very well it can,And three examples of the like have beenWithin my age. But reason with the fellow,Before you punish him, where he heard this,Lest you shall chance to whip your informationAnd beat the messenger who bids bewareOf what is to be dreaded.SICINIUSTell not me:I know this cannot be.BRUTUSNot possible.Enter a MessengerMessengerThe nobles in great earnestness are goingAll to the senate-house: some news is comeThat turns their countenances.SICINIUS'Tis this slave;--Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;Nothing but his report.MessengerYes, worthy sir,The slave's report is seconded; and more,More fearful, is deliver'd.SICINIUSWhat more fearful?MessengerIt is spoke freely out of many mouths--How probable I do not know--that Marcius,Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,And vows revenge as spacious as betweenThe young'st and oldest thing.SICINIUSThis is most likely!BRUTUSRaised only, that the weaker sort may wishGood Marcius home again.SICINIUSThe very trick on't.MENENIUSThis is unlikely:He and Aufidius can no more atoneThan violentest contrariety.Enter a second MessengerSecond MessengerYou are sent for to the senate:A fearful army, led by Caius MarciusAssociated with Aufidius, ragesUpon our territories; and have alreadyO'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and tookWhat lay before them.Enter COMINIUSCOMINIUSO, you have made good work!MENENIUSWhat news? what news?COMINIUSYou have holp to ravish your own daughters andTo melt the city leads upon your pates,To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--MENENIUSWhat's the news? what's the news?COMINIUSYour temples burned in their cement, andYour franchises, whereon you stood, confinedInto an auger's bore.MENENIUSPray now, your news?You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--COMINIUSIf!He is their god: he leads them like a thingMade by some other deity than nature,That shapes man better; and they follow him,Against us brats, with no less confidenceThan boys pursuing summer butterflies,Or butchers killing flies.MENENIUSYou have made good work,You and your apron-men; you that stood so up muchon the voice of occupation andThe breath of garlic-eaters!COMINIUSHe will shakeYour Rome about your ears.MENENIUSAs HerculesDid shake down mellow fruit.You have made fair work!BRUTUSBut is this true, sir?COMINIUSAy; and you'll look paleBefore you find it other. All the regionsDo smilingly revolt; and who resistAre mock'd for valiant ignorance,And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?Your enemies and his find something in him.MENENIUSWe are all undone, unlessThe noble man have mercy.COMINIUSWho shall ask it?The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the peopleDeserve such pity of him as the wolfDoes of the shepherds: for his best friends, if theyShould say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him evenAs those should do that had deserved his hate,And therein show'd like enemies.MENENIUS'Tis true:If he were putting to my house the brandThat should consume it, I have not the faceTo say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!COMINIUSYou have broughtA trembling upon Rome, such as was neverSo incapable of help.Both TribunesSay not we brought it.MENENIUSHow! Was it we? we loved him but, like beastsAnd cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,Who did hoot him out o' the city.COMINIUSBut I fearThey'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,The second name of men, obeys his pointsAs if he were his officer: desperationIs all the policy, strength and defence,That Rome can make against them.Enter a troop of CitizensMENENIUSHere come the clusters.And is Aufidius with him? You are theyThat made the air unwholesome, when you castYour stinking greasy caps in hooting atCoriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;And not a hair upon a soldier's headWhich will not prove a whip: as many coxcombsAs you threw caps up will he tumble down,And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;if he could burn us all into one coal,We have deserved it.CitizensFaith, we hear fearful news.First CitizenFor mine own part,When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.Second CitizenAnd so did I.Third CitizenAnd so did I; and, to say the truth, so did verymany of us: that we did, we did for the best; andthough we willingly consented to his banishment, yetit was against our will.COMINIUSYe re goodly things, you voices!MENENIUSYou have madeGood work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?COMINIUSO, ay, what else?Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUSSICINIUSGo, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:These are a side that would be glad to haveThis true which they so seem to fear. Go home,And show no sign of fear.First CitizenThe gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banishedhim.Second CitizenSo did we all. But, come, let's home.Exeunt CitizensBRUTUSI do not like this news.SICINIUSNor I.BRUTUSLet's to the Capitol. Would half my wealthWould buy this for a lie!SICINIUSPray, let us go.ExeuntSCENE VII. A camp, at a small distance from Rome.Enter AUFIDIUS and his LieutenantAUFIDIUSDo they still fly to the Roman?LieutenantI do not know what witchcraft's in him, butYour soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;And you are darken'd in this action, sir,Even by your own.AUFIDIUSI cannot help it now,Unless, by using means, I lame the footOf our design. He bears himself more proudlier,Even to my person, than I thought he wouldWhen first I did embrace him: yet his natureIn that's no changeling; and I must excuseWhat cannot be amended.LieutenantYet I wish, sir,--I mean for your particular,--you had notJoin'd in commission with him; but eitherHad borne the action of yourself, or elseTo him had left it solely.AUFIDIUSI understand thee well; and be thou sure,when he shall come to his account, he knows notWhat I can urge against him. Although it seems,And so he thinks, and is no less apparentTo the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soonAs draw his sword; yet he hath left undoneThat which shall break his neck or hazard mine,Whene'er we come to our account.LieutenantSir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?AUFIDIUSAll places yield to him ere he sits down;And the nobility of Rome are his:The senators and patricians love him too:The tribunes are no soldiers; and their peopleWill be as rash in the repeal, as hastyTo expel him thence. I think he'll be to RomeAs is the osprey to the fish, who takes itBy sovereignty of nature. First he wasA noble servant to them; but he could notCarry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,Which out of daily fortune ever taintsThe happy man; whether defect of judgment,To fail in the disposing of those chancesWhich he was lord of; or whether nature,Not to be other than one thing, not movingFrom the casque to the cushion, but commanding peaceEven with the same austerity and garbAs he controll'd the war; but one of these--As he hath spices of them all, not all,For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,To choke it in the utterance. So our virtuesLie in the interpretation of the time:And power, unto itself most commendable,Hath not a tomb so evident as a chairTo extol what it hath done.One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.ExeuntACT VSCENE I. Rome. A public place.Enter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS, BRUTUS, and othersMENENIUSNo, I'll not go: you hear what he hath saidWhich was sometime his general; who loved himIn a most dear particular. He call'd me father:But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;A mile before his tent fall down, and kneeThe way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'dTo hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.COMINIUSHe would not seem to know me.MENENIUSDo you hear?COMINIUSYet one time he did call me by my name:I urged our old acquaintance, and the dropsThat we have bled together. CoriolanusHe would not answer to: forbad all names;He was a kind of nothing, titleless,Till he had forged himself a name o' the fireOf burning Rome.MENENIUSWhy, so: you have made good work!A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!COMINIUSI minded him how royal 'twas to pardonWhen it was less expected: he replied,It was a bare petition of a stateTo one whom they had punish'd.MENENIUSVery well:Could he say less?COMINIUSI offer'd to awaken his regardFor's private friends: his answer to me was,He could not stay to pick them in a pileOf noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,And still to nose the offence.MENENIUSFor one poor grain or two!I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:You are the musty chaff; and you are smeltAbove the moon: we must be burnt for you.SICINIUSNay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aidIn this so never-needed help, yet do notUpbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if youWould be your country's pleader, your good tongue,More than the instant army we can make,Might stop our countryman.MENENIUSNo, I'll not meddle.SICINIUSPray you, go to him.MENENIUSWhat should I do?BRUTUSOnly make trial what your love can doFor Rome, towards Marcius.MENENIUSWell, and say that MarciusReturn me, as Cominius is return'd,Unheard; what then?But as a discontented friend, grief-shotWith his unkindness? say't be so?SICINIUSYet your good willmust have that thanks from Rome, after the measureAs you intended well.MENENIUSI'll undertake 't:I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lipAnd hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.He was not taken well; he had not dined:The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and thenWe pout upon the morning, are unaptTo give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'dThese and these conveyances of our bloodWith wine and feeding, we have suppler soulsThan in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch himTill he be dieted to my request,And then I'll set upon him.BRUTUSYou know the very road into his kindness,And cannot lose your way.MENENIUSGood faith, I'll prove him,Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledgeOf my success.ExitCOMINIUSHe'll never hear him.SICINIUSNot?COMINIUSI tell you, he does sit in gold, his eyeRed as 'twould burn Rome; and his injuryThe gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd meThus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,He sent in writing after me; what he would not,Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:So that all hope is vain.Unless his noble mother, and his wife;Who, as I hear, mean to solicit himFor mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,And with our fair entreaties haste them on.ExeuntSCENE II. Entrance of the Volscian camp before Rome.Two Sentinels on guard.Enter to them, MENENIUSFirst SenatorStay: whence are you?Second SenatorStand, and go back.MENENIUSYou guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,I am an officer of state, and comeTo speak with Coriolanus.First SenatorFrom whence?MENENIUSFrom Rome.First SenatorYou may not pass, you must return: our generalWill no more hear from thence.Second SenatorYou'll see your Rome embraced with fire beforeYou'll speak with Coriolanus.MENENIUSGood my friends,If you have heard your general talk of Rome,And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.First SenatorBe it so; go back: the virtue of your nameIs not here passable.MENENIUSI tell thee, fellow,The general is my lover: I have beenThe book of his good acts, whence men have readHis name unparallel'd, haply amplified;For I have ever verified my friends,Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verityWould without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praiseHave almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,I must have leave to pass.First SenatorFaith, sir, if you had told as many lies in hisbehalf as you have uttered words in your own, youshould not pass here; no, though it were as virtuousto lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.MENENIUSPrithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,always factionary on the party of your general.Second SenatorHowsoever you have been his liar, as you say youhave, I am one that, telling true under him, mustsay, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.MENENIUSHas he dined, canst thou tell? for I would notspeak with him till after dinner.First SenatorYou are a Roman, are you?MENENIUSI am, as thy general is.First SenatorThen you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,when you have pushed out your gates the verydefender of them, and, in a violent popularignorance, given your enemy your shield, think tofront his revenges with the easy groans of oldwomen, the virginal palms of your daughters, or withthe palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant asyou seem to be? Can you think to blow out theintended fire your city is ready to flame in, withsuch weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for yourexecution: you are condemned, our general has swornyou out of reprieve and pardon.MENENIUSSirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he woulduse me with estimation.Second SenatorCome, my captain knows you not.MENENIUSI mean, thy general.First SenatorMy general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lestI let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that'sthe utmost of your having: back.MENENIUSNay, but, fellow, fellow,--Enter CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUSCORIOLANUSWhat's the matter?MENENIUSNow, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shallperceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me frommy son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainmentwith him, if thou standest not i' the state ofhanging, or of some death more long inspectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold nowpresently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.To CORIOLANUSThe glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thyparticular prosperity, and love thee no worse thanthy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here'swater to quench it. I was hardly moved to come tothee; but being assured none but myself could movethee, I have been blown out of your gates withsighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thypetitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thywrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlethere,--this, who, like a block, hath denied myaccess to thee.CORIOLANUSAway!MENENIUSHow! away!CORIOLANUSWife, mother, child, I know not. My affairsAre servanted to others: though I oweMy revenge properly, my remission liesIn Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, ratherThan pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.Mine ears against your suits are stronger thanYour gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,Take this along; I writ it for thy sakeGives a letterAnd would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!AUFIDIUSYou keep a constant temper.Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUSFirst SenatorNow, sir, is your name Menenius?Second Senator'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know theway home again.First SenatorDo you hear how we are shent for keeping yourgreatness back?Second SenatorWhat cause, do you think, I have to swoon?MENENIUSI neither care for the world nor your general: forsuch things as you, I can scarce think there's any,ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die byhimself fears it not from another: let your generaldo his worst. For you, be that you are, long; andyour misery increase with your age! I say to you,as I was said to, Away!ExitFirst SenatorA noble fellow, I warrant him.Second SenatorThe worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, theoak not to be wind-shaken.ExeuntSCENE III. The tent of Coriolanus.Enter CORIOLANUS, AUFIDIUS, and othersCORIOLANUSWe will before the walls of Rome tomorrowSet down our host. My partner in this action,You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainlyI have borne this business.AUFIDIUSOnly their endsYou have respected; stopp'd your ears againstThe general suit of Rome; never admittedA private whisper, no, not with such friendsThat thought them sure of you.CORIOLANUSThis last old man,Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,Loved me above the measure of a father;Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refugeWas to send him; for whose old love I have,Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'dThe first conditions, which they did refuseAnd cannot now accept; to grace him onlyThat thought he could do more, a very littleI have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafterWill I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?Shout withinShall I be tempted to infringe my vowIn the same time 'tis made? I will not.Enter in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA, leading young MARCIUS, VALERIA, and AttendantsMy wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mouldWherein this trunk was framed, and in her handThe grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!All bond and privilege of nature, break!Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am notOf stronger earth than others. My mother bows;As if Olympus to a molehill shouldIn supplication nod: and my young boyHath an aspect of intercession, whichGreat nature cries 'Deny not.' let the VolscesPlough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll neverBe such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,As if a man were author of himselfAnd knew no other kin.VIRGILIAMy lord and husband!CORIOLANUSThese eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.VIRGILIAThe sorrow that delivers us thus changedMakes you think so.CORIOLANUSLike a dull actor now,I have forgot my part, and I am out,Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,Forgive my tyranny; but do not sayFor that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kissLong as my exile, sweet as my revenge!Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kissI carried from thee, dear; and my true lipHath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,And the most noble mother of the worldLeave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;KneelsOf thy deep duty more impression showThan that of common sons.VOLUMNIAO, stand up blest!Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,I kneel before thee; and unproperlyShow duty, as mistaken all this whileBetween the child and parent.KneelsCORIOLANUSWhat is this?Your knees to me? to your corrected son?Then let the pebbles on the hungry beachFillip the stars; then let the mutinous windsStrike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;Murdering impossibility, to makeWhat cannot be, slight work.VOLUMNIAThou art my warrior;I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?CORIOLANUSThe noble sister of Publicola,The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicleThat's curdied by the frost from purest snowAnd hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!VOLUMNIAThis is a poor epitome of yours,Which by the interpretation of full timeMay show like all yourself.CORIOLANUSThe god of soldiers,With the consent of supreme Jove, informThy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst proveTo shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the warsLike a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,And saving those that eye thee!VOLUMNIAYour knee, sirrah.CORIOLANUSThat's my brave boy!VOLUMNIAEven he, your wife, this lady, and myself,Are suitors to you.CORIOLANUSI beseech you, peace:Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:The thing I have forsworn to grant may neverBe held by you denials. Do not bid meDismiss my soldiers, or capitulateAgain with Rome's mechanics: tell me notWherein I seem unnatural: desire notTo ally my rages and revenges withYour colder reasons.VOLUMNIAO, no more, no more!You have said you will not grant us any thing;For we have nothing else to ask, but thatWhich you deny already: yet we will ask;That, if you fail in our request, the blameMay hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.CORIOLANUSAufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'llHear nought from Rome in private. Your request?VOLUMNIAShould we be silent and not speak, our raimentAnd state of bodies would bewray what lifeWe have led since thy exile. Think with thyselfHow more unfortunate than all living womenAre we come hither: since that thy sight,which shouldMake our eyes flow with joy, hearts dancewith comforts,Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;Making the mother, wife and child to seeThe son, the husband and the father tearingHis country's bowels out. And to poor weThine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st usOur prayers to the gods, which is a comfortThat all but we enjoy; for how can we,Alas, how can we for our country pray.Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must loseThe country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,Our comfort in the country. We must findAn evident calamity, though we hadOur wish, which side should win: for either thouMust, as a foreign recreant, be ledWith manacles thorough our streets, or elsetriumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,And bear the palm for having bravely shedThy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,I purpose not to wait on fortune tillThese wars determine: if I cannot persuade theeRather to show a noble grace to both partsThan seek the end of one, thou shalt no soonerMarch to assault thy country than to tread--Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,That brought thee to this world.VIRGILIAAy, and mine,That brought you forth this boy, to keep your nameLiving to time.Young MARCIUSA' shall not tread on me;I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.CORIOLANUSNot of a woman's tenderness to be,Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.I have sat too long.RisingVOLUMNIANay, go not from us thus.If it were so that our request did tendTo save the Romans, thereby to destroyThe Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,As poisonous of your honour: no; our suitIs that you reconcile them: while the VolscesMay say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,'This we received;' and each in either sideGive the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blestFor making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefitWhich thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,But with his last attempt he wiped it out;Destroy'd his country, and his name remainsTo the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,To imitate the graces of the gods;To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,And yet to charge thy sulphur with a boltThat should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?Think'st thou it honourable for a noble manStill to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:Perhaps thy childishness will move him moreThan can our reasons. There's no man in the worldMore bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prateLike one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy lifeShow'd thy dear mother any courtesy,When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,And spurn me back: but if it be not so,Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,That thou restrain'st from me the duty whichTo a mother's part belongs. He turns away:Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more prideThan pity to our prayers. Down: an end;This is the last: so we will home to Rome,And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:This boy, that cannot tell what he would haveBut kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,Does reason our petition with more strengthThan thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;His wife is in Corioli and his childLike him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,And then I'll speak a little.He holds her by the hand, silentCORIOLANUSO mother, mother!What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,The gods look down, and this unnatural sceneThey laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!You have won a happy victory to Rome;But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,Were you in my stead, would you have heardA mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?AUFIDIUSI was moved withal.CORIOLANUSI dare be sworn you were:And, sir, it is no little thing to makeMine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!AUFIDIUS[Aside] I am glad thou hast set thy mercy andthy honourAt difference in thee: out of that I'll workMyself a former fortune.The Ladies make signs to CORIOLANUSCORIOLANUSAy, by and by;To VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, & cBut we will drink together; and you shall bearA better witness back than words, which we,On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserveTo have a temple built you: all the swordsIn Italy, and her confederate arms,Could not have made this peace.ExeuntSCENE IV. Rome. A public place.Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUSMENENIUSSee you yond coign o' the Capitol, yondcorner-stone?SICINIUSWhy, what of that?MENENIUSIf it be possible for you to displace it with yourlittle finger, there is some hope the ladies ofRome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.But I say there is no hope in't: our throats aresentenced and stay upon execution.SICINIUSIs't possible that so short a time can alter thecondition of a man!MENENIUSThere is differency between a grub and a butterfly;yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grownfrom man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than acreeping thing.SICINIUSHe loved his mother dearly.MENENIUSSo did he me: and he no more remembers his mothernow than an eight-year-old horse. The tartnessof his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, hemoves like an engine, and the ground shrinks beforehis treading: he is able to pierce a corslet withhis eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is abattery. He sits in his state, as a thing made forAlexander. What he bids be done is finished withhis bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternityand a heaven to throne in.SICINIUSYes, mercy, if you report him truly.MENENIUSI paint him in the character. Mark what mercy hismother shall bring from him: there is no more mercyin him than there is milk in a male tiger; thatshall our poor city find: and all this is long ofyou.SICINIUSThe gods be good unto us!MENENIUSNo, in such a case the gods will not be good untous. When we banished him, we respected not them;and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.Enter a MessengerMessengerSir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:The plebeians have got your fellow-tribuneAnd hale him up and down, all swearing, ifThe Roman ladies bring not comfort home,They'll give him death by inches.Enter a second MessengerSICINIUSWhat's the news?Second MessengerGood news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.SICINIUSFriend,Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?Second MessengerAs certain as I know the sun is fire:Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!Trumpets; hautboys; drums beat; all togetherThe trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,Make the sun dance. Hark you!A shout withinMENENIUSThis is good news:I will go meet the ladies. This VolumniaIs worth of consuls, senators, patricians,A city full; of tribunes, such as you,A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:This morning for ten thousand of your throatsI'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!Music still, with shoutsSICINIUSFirst, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,Accept my thankfulness.Second MessengerSir, we have allGreat cause to give great thanks.SICINIUSThey are near the city?Second MessengerAlmost at point to enter.SICINIUSWe will meet them,And help the joy.ExeuntSCENE V.

A street near the gate.Enter two Senators with VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, VALERIA, & c. passing over the stage, followed by Patricians and othersFirst SenatorBehold our patroness, the life of Rome!Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'AllWelcome, ladies, Welcome!A flourish with drums and trumpets. ExeuntSCENE VI. Antium. A public place.Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, with AttendantsAUFIDIUSGo tell the lords o' the city I am here:Deliver them this paper: having read it,Bid them repair to the market place; where I,Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuseThe city ports by this hath enter'd andIntends to appear before the people, hopingTo purge herself with words: dispatch.Exeunt AttendantsEnter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS' factionMost welcome!First ConspiratorHow is it with our general?AUFIDIUSEven soAs with a man by his own alms empoison'd,And with his charity slain.Second ConspiratorMost noble sir,If you do hold the same intent whereinYou wish'd us parties, we'll deliver youOf your great danger.AUFIDIUSSir, I cannot tell:We must proceed as we do find the people.Third ConspiratorThe people will remain uncertain whilst'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of eitherMakes the survivor heir of all.AUFIDIUSI know it;And my pretext to strike at him admitsA good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'dMine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,He bow'd his nature, never known beforeBut to be rough, unswayable and free.Third ConspiratorSir, his stoutnessWhen he did stand for consul, which he lostBy lack of stooping,--AUFIDIUSThat I would have spoke of:Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;Made him joint-servant with me; gave him wayIn all his own desires; nay, let him chooseOut of my files, his projects to accomplish,My best and freshest men; served his designmentsIn mine own person; holp to reap the fameWhich he did end all his; and took some prideTo do myself this wrong: till, at the last,I seem'd his follower, not partner, andHe waged me with his countenance, as ifI had been mercenary.First ConspiratorSo he did, my lord:The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,When he had carried Rome and that we look'dFor no less spoil than glory,--AUFIDIUSThere was it:For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.At a few drops of women's rheum, which areAs cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labourOf our great action: therefore shall he die,And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the PeopleFirst ConspiratorYour native town you enter'd like a post,And had no welcomes home: but he returns,Splitting the air with noise.Second ConspiratorAnd patient fools,Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tearWith giving him glory.Third ConspiratorTherefore, at your vantage,Ere he express himself, or move the peopleWith what he would say, let him feel your sword,Which we will second. When he lies along,After your way his tale pronounced shall buryHis reasons with his body.AUFIDIUSSay no more:Here come the lords.Enter the Lords of the cityAll The LordsYou are most welcome home.AUFIDIUSI have not deserved it.But, worthy lords, have you with heed perusedWhat I have written to you?LordsWe have.First LordAnd grieve to hear't.What faults he made before the last, I thinkMight have found easy fines: but there to endWhere he was to begin and give awayThe benefit of our levies, answering usWith our own charge, making a treaty whereThere was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.AUFIDIUSHe approaches: you shall hear him.Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours; commoners being with himCORIOLANUSHail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,No more infected with my country's loveThan when I parted hence, but still subsistingUnder your great command. You are to knowThat prosperously I have attempted andWith bloody passage led your wars even toThe gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought homeDo more than counterpoise a full third partThe charges of the action. We have made peaceWith no less honour to the AntiatesThan shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,Together with the seal o' the senate, whatWe have compounded on.AUFIDIUSRead it not, noble lords;But tell the traitor, in the high'st degreeHe hath abused your powers.CORIOLANUSTraitor! how now!AUFIDIUSAy, traitor, Marcius!CORIOLANUSMarcius!AUFIDIUSAy, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou thinkI'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n nameCoriolanus in Corioli?You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiouslyHe has betray'd your business, and given up,For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;Breaking his oath and resolution likeA twist of rotten silk, never admittingCounsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tearsHe whined and roar'd away your victory,That pages blush'd at him and men of heartLook'd wondering each at other.CORIOLANUSHear'st thou, Mars?AUFIDIUSName not the god, thou boy of tears!CORIOLANUSHa!AUFIDIUSNo more.CORIOLANUSMeasureless liar, thou hast made my heartToo great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that everI was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; thatMust bear my beating to his grave--shall joinTo thrust the lie unto him.First LordPeace, both, and hear me speak.CORIOLANUSCut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, IFlutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:Alone I did it. Boy!AUFIDIUSWhy, noble lords,Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,'Fore your own eyes and ears?All ConspiratorsLet him die for't.All The People'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'dmy son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousinMarcus.' 'He killed my father.'Second LordPeace, ho! no outrage: peace!The man is noble and his fame folds-inThis orb o' the earth. His last offences to usShall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,And trouble not the peace.CORIOLANUSO that I had him,With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,To use my lawful sword!AUFIDIUSInsolent villain!All ConspiratorsKill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!The Conspirators draw, and kill CORIOLANUS: AUFIDIUS stands on his bodyLordsHold, hold, hold, hold!AUFIDIUSMy noble masters, hear me speak.First LordO Tullus,--Second LordThou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.Third LordTread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;Put up your swords.AUFIDIUSMy lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,Provoked by him, you cannot--the great dangerWhich this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoiceThat he is thus cut off. Please it your honoursTo call me to your senate, I'll deliverMyself your loyal servant, or endureYour heaviest censure.First LordBear from hence his body;And mourn you for him: let him be regardedAs the most noble corse that ever heraldDid follow to his urn.Second LordHis own impatienceTakes from Aufidius a great part of blame.Let's make the best of it.AUFIDIUSMy rage is gone;And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city heHath widow'd and unchilded many a one,Which to this hour bewail the injury,Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.Exeunt, bearing the body of CORIOLANUS.

Bernardo!BERNARDOSay,What, is Horatio there?HORATIOA piece of him.BERNARDOWelcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.MARCELLUSWhat, has this thing appear'd again to-night?BERNARDOI have seen nothing.MARCELLUSHoratio says 'tis but our fantasy,And will not let belief take hold of himTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:Therefore I have entreated him alongWith us to watch the minutes of this night;That if again this apparition come,He may approve our eyes and speak to it.HORATIOTush, tush, 'twill not appear.BERNARDOSit down awhile;And let us once again assail your ears,That are so fortified against our storyWhat we have two nights seen.HORATIOWell, sit we down,And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.BERNARDOLast night of all,When yond same star that's westward from the poleHad made his course to illume that part of heavenWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself,The bell then beating one,--Enter GhostMARCELLUSPeace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!BERNARDOIn the same figure, like the king that's dead.MARCELLUSThou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.BERNARDOLooks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.HORATIOMost like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.BERNARDOIt would be spoke to.MARCELLUSQuestion it, Horatio.HORATIOWhat art thou that usurp'st this time of night,Together with that fair and warlike formIn which the majesty of buried DenmarkDid sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!MARCELLUSIt is offended.BERNARDOSee, it stalks away!HORATIOStay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!Exit GhostMARCELLUS'Tis gone, and will not answer.BERNARDOHow now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:Is not this something more than fantasy?What think you on't?HORATIOBefore my God, I might not this believeWithout the sensible and true avouchOf mine own eyes.MARCELLUSIs it not like the king?HORATIOAs thou art to thyself:Such was the very armour he had onWhen he the ambitious Norway combated;So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.'Tis strange.MARCELLUSThus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.HORATIOIn what particular thought to work I know not;But in the gross and scope of my opinion,This bodes some strange eruption to our state.MARCELLUSGood now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,Why this same strict and most observant watchSo nightly toils the subject of the land,And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,And foreign mart for implements of war;Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore taskDoes not divide the Sunday from the week;What might be toward, that this sweaty hasteDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day:Who is't that can inform me?HORATIOThat can I;At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,Whose image even but now appear'd to us,Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,Well ratified by law and heraldry,Did forfeit, with his life, all those his landsWhich he stood seized of, to the conqueror:Against the which, a moiety competentWas gaged by our king; which had return'dTo the inheritance of Fortinbras,Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,And carriage of the article design'd,His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,Of unimproved mettle hot and full,Hath in the skirts of Norway here and thereShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,For food and diet, to some enterpriseThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other--As it doth well appear unto our state--But to recover of us, by strong handAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid landsSo by his father lost: and this, I take it,Is the main motive of our preparations,The source of this our watch and the chief headOf this post-haste and romage in the land.BERNARDOI think it be no other but e'en so:Well may it sort that this portentous figureComes armed through our watch; so like the kingThat was and is the question of these wars.HORATIOA mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.In the most high and palmy state of Rome,A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted deadDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,Disasters in the sun; and the moist starUpon whose influence Neptune's empire standsWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:And even the like precurse of fierce events,As harbingers preceding still the fatesAnd prologue to the omen coming on,Have heaven and earth together demonstratedUnto our climatures and countrymen.--But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!Re-enter GhostI'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,Speak to me:If there be any good thing to be done,That may to thee do ease and grace to me,Speak to me:Cock crowsIf thou art privy to thy country's fate,Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy lifeExtorted treasure in the womb of earth,For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.MARCELLUSShall I strike at it with my partisan?HORATIODo, if it will not stand.BERNARDO'Tis here!HORATIO'Tis here!MARCELLUS'Tis gone!Exit GhostWe do it wrong, being so majestical,To offer it the show of violence;For it is, as the air, invulnerable,And our vain blows malicious mockery.BERNARDOIt was about to speak, when the cock crew.HORATIOAnd then it started like a guilty thingUpon a fearful summons. I have heard,The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throatAwake the god of day; and, at his warning,Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,The extravagant and erring spirit hiesTo his confine: and of the truth hereinThis present object made probation.MARCELLUSIt faded on the crowing of the cock.Some say that ever 'gainst that season comesWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,The bird of dawning singeth all night long:And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.HORATIOSo have I heard and do in part believe it.But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:Break we our watch up; and by my advice,Let us impart what we have seen to-nightUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?MARCELLUSLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning knowWhere we shall find him most conveniently.ExeuntSCENE II. A room of state in the castle.Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and AttendantsKING CLAUDIUSThough yet of Hamlet our dear brother's deathThe memory be green, and that it us befittedTo bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdomTo be contracted in one brow of woe,Yet so far hath discretion fought with natureThat we with wisest sorrow think on him,Together with remembrance of ourselves.Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,The imperial jointress to this warlike state,Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--With an auspicious and a dropping eye,With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'dYour better wisdoms, which have freely goneWith this affair along. For all, our thanks.Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,Holding a weak supposal of our worth,Or thinking by our late dear brother's deathOur state to be disjoint and out of frame,Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,Importing the surrender of those landsLost by his father, with all bonds of law,To our most valiant brother. So much for him.Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:Thus much the business is: we have here writTo Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hearsOf this his nephew's purpose,--to suppressHis further gait herein; in that the levies,The lists and full proportions, are all madeOut of his subject: and we here dispatchYou, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;Giving to you no further personal powerTo business with the king, more than the scopeOf these delated articles allow.Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.CORNELIUS VOLTIMANDIn that and all things will we show our duty.KING CLAUDIUSWe doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUSAnd now, Laertes, what's the news with you?You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?The head is not more native to the heart,The hand more instrumental to the mouth,Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.What wouldst thou have, Laertes?LAERTESMy dread lord,Your leave and favour to return to France;From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,To show my duty in your coronation,Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,My thoughts and wishes bend again toward FranceAnd bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.KING CLAUDIUSHave you your father's leave? What says Polonius?LORD POLONIUSHe hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leaveBy laboursome petition, and at lastUpon his will I seal'd my hard consent:I do beseech you, give him leave to go.KING CLAUDIUSTake thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,And thy best graces spend it at thy will!But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--HAMLET[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.KING CLAUDIUSHow is it that the clouds still hang on you?HAMLETNot so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.QUEEN GERTRUDEGood Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.Do not for ever with thy vailed lidsSeek for thy noble father in the dust:Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,Passing through nature to eternity.HAMLETAy, madam, it is common.QUEEN GERTRUDEIf it be,Why seems it so particular with thee?HAMLETSeems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.''Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,Nor customary suits of solemn black,Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,For they are actions that a man might play:But I have that within which passeth show;These but the trappings and the suits of woe.KING CLAUDIUS'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,To give these mourning duties to your father:But, you must know, your father lost a father;That father lost, lost his, and the survivor boundIn filial obligation for some termTo do obsequious sorrow: but to perseverIn obstinate condolement is a courseOf impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,An understanding simple and unschool'd:For what we know must be and is as commonAs any the most vulgar thing to sense,Why should we in our peevish oppositionTake it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,To reason most absurd: whose common themeIs death of fathers, and who still hath cried,From the first corse till he that died to-day,'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earthThis unprevailing woe, and think of usAs of a father: for let the world take note,You are the most immediate to our throne;And with no less nobility of loveThan that which dearest father bears his son,Do I impart toward you. For your intentIn going back to school in Wittenberg,It is most retrograde to our desire:And we beseech you, bend you to remainHere, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.QUEEN GERTRUDELet not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.HAMLETI shall in all my best obey you, madam.KING CLAUDIUSWhy, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;This gentle and unforced accord of HamletSits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.Exeunt all but HAMLETHAMLETO, that this too too solid flesh would meltThaw and resolve itself into a dew!Or that the Everlasting had not fix'dHis canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,Seem to me all the uses of this world!Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,That grows to seed; things rank and gross in naturePossess it merely. That it should come to this!But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:So excellent a king; that was, to this,Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my motherThat he might not beteem the winds of heavenVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,As if increase of appetite had grownBy what it fed on: and yet, within a month--Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--A little month, or ere those shoes were oldWith which she follow'd my poor father's body,Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,My father's brother, but no more like my fatherThan I to Hercules: within a month:Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tearsHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,She married. O, most wicked speed, to postWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!It is not nor it cannot come to good:But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDOHORATIOHail to your lordship!HAMLETI am glad to see you well:Horatio,--or I do forget myself.HORATIOThe same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.HAMLETSir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?MARCELLUSMy good lord--HAMLETI am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?HORATIOA truant disposition, good my lord.HAMLETI would not hear your enemy say so,Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,To make it truster of your own reportAgainst yourself: I know you are no truant.But what is your affair in Elsinore?We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.HORATIOMy lord, I came to see your father's funeral.HAMLETI pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;I think it was to see my mother's wedding.HORATIOIndeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.HAMLETThrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meatsDid coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.Would I had met my dearest foe in heavenOr ever I had seen that day, Horatio!My father!--methinks I see my father.HORATIOWhere, my lord?HAMLETIn my mind's eye, Horatio.HORATIOI saw him once; he was a goodly king.HAMLETHe was a man, take him for all in all,I shall not look upon his like again.HORATIOMy lord, I think I saw him yesternight.HAMLETSaw? who?HORATIOMy lord, the king your father.HAMLETThe king my father!HORATIOSeason your admiration for awhileWith an attent ear, till I may deliver,Upon the witness of these gentlemen,This marvel to you.HAMLETFor God's love, let me hear.HORATIOTwo nights together had these gentlemen,Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,In the dead vast and middle of the night,Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,Appears before them, and with solemn marchGoes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'dBy their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilledAlmost to jelly with the act of fear,Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to meIn dreadful secrecy impart they did;And I with them the third night kept the watch;Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,Form of the thing, each word made true and good,The apparition comes: I knew your father;These hands are not more like.HAMLETBut where was this?MARCELLUSMy lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.HAMLETDid you not speak to it?HORATIOMy lord, I did;But answer made it none: yet once methoughtIt lifted up its head and did addressItself to motion, like as it would speak;But even then the morning cock crew loud,And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,And vanish'd from our sight.HAMLET'Tis very strange.HORATIOAs I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;And we did think it writ down in our dutyTo let you know of it.HAMLETIndeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.Hold you the watch to-night?MARCELLUS BERNARDOWe do, my lord.HAMLETArm'd, say you?MARCELLUS BERNARDOArm'd, my lord.HAMLETFrom top to toe?MARCELLUS BERNARDOMy lord, from head to foot.HAMLETThen saw you not his face?HORATIOO, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.HAMLETWhat, look'd he frowningly?HORATIOA countenance more in sorrow than in anger.HAMLETPale or red?HORATIONay, very pale.HAMLETAnd fix'd his eyes upon you?HORATIOMost constantly.HAMLETI would I had been there.HORATIOIt would have much amazed you.HAMLETVery like, very like. Stay'd it long?HORATIOWhile one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.MARCELLUS BERNARDOLonger, longer.HORATIONot when I saw't.HAMLETHis beard was grizzled--no?HORATIOIt was, as I have seen it in his life,A sable silver'd.HAMLETI will watch to-night;Perchance 'twill walk again.HORATIOI warrant it will.HAMLETIf it assume my noble father's person,I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gapeAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,Let it be tenable in your silence still;And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,Give it an understanding, but no tongue:I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,I'll visit you.AllOur duty to your honour.HAMLETYour loves, as mine to you: farewell.Exeunt all but HAMLETMy father's spirit in arms! all is not well;I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.ExitSCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.Enter LAERTES and OPHELIALAERTESMy necessaries are embark'd: farewell:And, sister, as the winds give benefitAnd convoy is assistant, do not sleep,But let me hear from you.OPHELIADo you doubt that?LAERTESFor Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,A violet in the youth of primy nature,Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.OPHELIANo more but so?LAERTESThink it no more;For nature, crescent, does not grow aloneIn thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,The inward service of the mind and soulGrows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirchThe virtue of his will: but you must fear,His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;For he himself is subject to his birth:He may not, as unvalued persons do,Carve for himself; for on his choice dependsThe safety and health of this whole state;And therefore must his choice be circumscribedUnto the voice and yielding of that bodyWhereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,It fits your wisdom so far to believe itAs he in his particular act and placeMay give his saying deed; which is no furtherThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,If with too credent ear you list his songs,Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure openTo his unmaster'd importunity.Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,And keep you in the rear of your affection,Out of the shot and danger of desire.The chariest maid is prodigal enough,If she unmask her beauty to the moon:Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:The canker galls the infants of the spring,Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,And in the morn and liquid dew of youthContagious blastments are most imminent.Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.OPHELIAI shall the effect of this good lesson keep,As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,And recks not his own rede.LAERTESO, fear me not.I stay too long: but here my father comes.Enter POLONIUSA double blessing is a double grace,Occasion smiles upon a second leave.LORD POLONIUSYet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!And these few precepts in thy memorySee thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,Nor any unproportioned thought his act.Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;But do not dull thy palm with entertainmentOf each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. BewareOf entrance to a quarrel, but being in,Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;For the apparel oft proclaims the man,And they in France of the best rank and stationAre of a most select and generous chief in that.Neither a borrower nor a lender be;For loan oft loses both itself and friend,And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.This above all: to thine ownself be true,And it must follow, as the night the day,Thou canst not then be false to any man.Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!LAERTESMost humbly do I take my leave, my lord.LORD POLONIUSThe time invites you; go; your servants tend.LAERTESFarewell, Ophelia; and remember wellWhat I have said to you.OPHELIA'Tis in my memory lock'd,And you yourself shall keep the key of it.LAERTESFarewell.ExitLORD POLONIUSWhat is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?OPHELIASo please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.LORD POLONIUSMarry, well bethought:'Tis told me, he hath very oft of lateGiven private time to you; and you yourselfHave of your audience been most free and bounteous:If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,And that in way of caution, I must tell you,You do not understand yourself so clearlyAs it behoves my daughter and your honour.What is between you? give me up the truth.OPHELIAHe hath, my lord, of late made many tendersOf his affection to me.LORD POLONIUSAffection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?OPHELIAI do not know, my lord, what I should think.LORD POLONIUSMarry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.OPHELIAMy lord, he hath importuned me with loveIn honourable fashion.LORD POLONIUSAy, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.OPHELIAAnd hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,With almost all the holy vows of heaven.LORD POLONIUSAy, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,When the blood burns, how prodigal the soulLends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,Even in their promise, as it is a-making,You must not take for fire. From this timeBe somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;Set your entreatments at a higher rateThan a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,Believe so much in him, that he is youngAnd with a larger tether may he walkThan may be given you: in few, Ophelia,Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,Not of that dye which their investments show,But mere implorators of unholy suits,Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,The better to beguile. This is for all:I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,Have you so slander any moment leisure,As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.OPHELIAI shall obey, my lord.ExeuntSCENE IV. The platform.Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUSHAMLETThe air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.HORATIOIt is a nipping and an eager air.HAMLETWhat hour now?HORATIOI think it lacks of twelve.HAMLETNo, it is struck.HORATIOIndeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the seasonWherein the spirit held his wont to walk.A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, withinWhat does this mean, my lord?HAMLETThe king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray outThe triumph of his pledge.HORATIOIs it a custom?HAMLETAy, marry, is't:But to my mind, though I am native hereAnd to the manner born, it is a customMore honour'd in the breach than the observance.This heavy-headed revel east and westMakes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phraseSoil our addition; and indeed it takesFrom our achievements, though perform'd at height,The pith and marrow of our attribute.So, oft it chances in particular men,That for some vicious mole of nature in them,As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,Since nature cannot choose his origin--By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavensThe form of plausive manners, that these men,Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,As infinite as man may undergo--Shall in the general censure take corruptionFrom that particular fault: the dram of ealeDoth all the noble substance of a doubtTo his own scandal.HORATIOLook, my lord, it comes!Enter GhostHAMLETAngels and ministers of grace defend us!Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,Be thy intents wicked or charitable,Thou comest in such a questionable shapeThat I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!Let me not burst in ignorance; but tellWhy thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,To cast thee up again. What may this mean,That thou, dead corse, again in complete steelRevisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,Making night hideous; and we fools of natureSo horridly to shake our dispositionWith thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?Ghost beckons HAMLETHORATIOIt beckons you to go away with it,As if it some impartment did desireTo you alone.MARCELLUSLook, with what courteous actionIt waves you to a more removed ground:But do not go with it.HORATIONo, by no means.HAMLETIt will not speak; then I will follow it.HORATIODo not, my lord.HAMLETWhy, what should be the fear?I do not set my life in a pin's fee;And for my soul, what can it do to that,Being a thing immortal as itself?It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.HORATIOWhat if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,Or to the dreadful summit of the cliffThat beetles o'er his base into the sea,And there assume some other horrible form,Which might deprive your sovereignty of reasonAnd draw you into madness? think of it:The very place puts toys of desperation,Without more motive, into every brainThat looks so many fathoms to the seaAnd hears it roar beneath.HAMLETIt waves me still.Go on; I'll follow thee.MARCELLUSYou shall not go, my lord.HAMLETHold off your hands.HORATIOBe ruled; you shall not go.HAMLETMy fate cries out,And makes each petty artery in this bodyAs hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.Exeunt Ghost and HAMLETHORATIOHe waxes desperate with imagination.MARCELLUSLet's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.HORATIOHave after. To what issue will this come?MARCELLUSSomething is rotten in the state of Denmark.HORATIOHeaven will direct it.MARCELLUSNay, let's follow him.ExeuntSCENE V. Another part of the platform.Enter GHOST and HAMLETHAMLETWhere wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.GhostMark me.HAMLETI will.GhostMy hour is almost come,When I to sulphurous and tormenting flamesMust render up myself.HAMLETAlas, poor ghost!GhostPity me not, but lend thy serious hearingTo what I shall unfold.HAMLETSpeak; I am bound to hear.GhostSo art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.HAMLETWhat?GhostI am thy father's spirit,Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,And for the day confined to fast in fires,Till the foul crimes done in my days of natureAre burnt and purged away. But that I am forbidTo tell the secrets of my prison-house,I could a tale unfold whose lightest wordWould harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,Thy knotted and combined locks to partAnd each particular hair to stand on end,Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:But this eternal blazon must not beTo ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!If thou didst ever thy dear father love--HAMLETO God!GhostRevenge his foul and most unnatural murder.HAMLETMurder!GhostMurder most foul, as in the best it is;But this most foul, strange and unnatural.HAMLETHaste me to know't, that I, with wings as swiftAs meditation or the thoughts of love,May sweep to my revenge.GhostI find thee apt;And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weedThat roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of DenmarkIs by a forged process of my deathRankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,The serpent that did sting thy father's lifeNow wears his crown.HAMLETO my prophetic soul! My uncle!GhostAy, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--O wicked wit and gifts, that have the powerSo to seduce!--won to his shameful lustThe will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!From me, whose love was of that dignityThat it went hand in hand even with the vowI made to her in marriage, and to declineUpon a wretch whose natural gifts were poorTo those of mine!But virtue, as it never will be moved,Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,Will sate itself in a celestial bed,And prey on garbage.But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,My custom always of the afternoon,Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,And in the porches of my ears did pourThe leperous distilment; whose effectHolds such an enmity with blood of manThat swift as quicksilver it courses throughThe natural gates and alleys of the body,And with a sudden vigour doth possetAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;And a most instant tetter bark'd about,Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,All my smooth body.Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's handOf life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,No reckoning made, but sent to my accountWith all my imperfections on my head:O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;Let not the royal bed of Denmark beA couch for luxury and damned incest.But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contriveAgainst thy mother aught: leave her to heavenAnd to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.ExitHAMLETO all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seatIn this distracted globe. Remember thee!Yea, from the table of my memoryI'll wipe away all trivial fond records,All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,That youth and observation copied there;And thy commandment all alone shall liveWithin the book and volume of my brain,Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!O most pernicious woman!O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!My tables,--meet it is I set it down,That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:WritingSo, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'I have sworn 't.MARCELLUS HORATIO[Within] My lord, my lord,--MARCELLUS[Within] Lord Hamlet,--HORATIO[Within] Heaven secure him!HAMLETSo be it!HORATIO[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!HAMLETHillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUSMARCELLUSHow is't, my noble lord?HORATIOWhat news, my lord?HAMLETO, wonderful!HORATIOGood my lord, tell it.HAMLETNo; you'll reveal it.HORATIONot I, my lord, by heaven.MARCELLUSNor I, my lord.HAMLETHow say you, then; would heart of man once think it?But you'll be secret?HORATIO MARCELLUSAy, by heaven, my lord.HAMLETThere's ne'er a villain dwelling in all DenmarkBut he's an arrant knave.HORATIOThere needs no ghost, my lord, come from the graveTo tell us this.HAMLETWhy, right; you are i' the right;And so, without more circumstance at all,I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:You, as your business and desire shall point you;For every man has business and desire,Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,Look you, I'll go pray.HORATIOThese are but wild and whirling words, my lord.HAMLETI'm sorry they offend you, heartily;Yes, 'faith heartily.HORATIOThere's no offence, my lord.HAMLETYes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,And much offence too. Touching this vision here,It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:For your desire to know what is between us,O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,Give me one poor request.HORATIOWhat is't, my lord? we will.HAMLETNever make known what you have seen to-night.HORATIO MARCELLUSMy lord, we will not.HAMLETNay, but swear't.HORATIOIn faith,My lord, not I.MARCELLUSNor I, my lord, in faith.HAMLETUpon my sword.MARCELLUSWe have sworn, my lord, already.HAMLETIndeed, upon my sword, indeed.Ghost[Beneath] Swear.HAMLETAh, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,truepenny?Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--Consent to swear.HORATIOPropose the oath, my lord.HAMLETNever to speak of this that you have seen,Swear by my sword.Ghost[Beneath] Swear.HAMLETHic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.Come hither, gentlemen,And lay your hands again upon my sword:Never to speak of this that you have heard,Swear by my sword.Ghost[Beneath] Swear.HAMLETWell said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?A worthy pioner!

A room in POLONIUS' house.Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDOLORD POLONIUSGive him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.REYNALDOI will, my lord.LORD POLONIUSYou shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,Before you visit him, to make inquireOf his behavior.REYNALDOMy lord, I did intend it.LORD POLONIUSMarry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,What company, at what expense; and findingBy this encompassment and drift of questionThat they do know my son, come you more nearerThan your particular demands will touch it:Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?REYNALDOAy, very well, my lord.LORD POLONIUS'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;Addicted so and so:' and there put on himWhat forgeries you please; marry, none so rankAs may dishonour him; take heed of that;But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slipsAs are companions noted and most knownTo youth and liberty.REYNALDOAs gaming, my lord.LORD POLONIUSAy, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,Drabbing: you may go so far.REYNALDOMy lord, that would dishonour him.LORD POLONIUS'Faith, no; as you may season it in the chargeYou must not put another scandal on him,That he is open to incontinency;That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintlyThat they may seem the taints of liberty,The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,A savageness in unreclaimed blood,Of general assault.REYNALDOBut, my good lord,--LORD POLONIUSWherefore should you do this?REYNALDOAy, my lord,I would know that.LORD POLONIUSMarry, sir, here's my drift;And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:You laying these slight sullies on my son,As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,Your party in converse, him you would sound,Having ever seen in the prenominate crimesThe youth you breathe of guilty, be assuredHe closes with you in this consequence;'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'According to the phrase or the additionOf man and country.REYNALDOVery good, my lord.LORD POLONIUSAnd then, sir, does he this--he does--what was Iabout to say? By the mass, I was about to saysomething: where did I leave?REYNALDOAt 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'and 'gentleman.'LORD POLONIUSAt 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.See you now;Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,With windlasses and with assays of bias,By indirections find directions out:So by my former lecture and advice,Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?REYNALDOMy lord, I have.LORD POLONIUSGod be wi' you; fare you well.REYNALDOGood my lord!LORD POLONIUSObserve his inclination in yourself.REYNALDOI shall, my lord.LORD POLONIUSAnd let him ply his music.REYNALDOWell, my lord.LORD POLONIUSFarewell!Exit REYNALDOEnter OPHELIAHow now, Ophelia! what's the matter?OPHELIAO, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!LORD POLONIUSWith what, i' the name of God?OPHELIAMy lord, as I was sewing in my closet,Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;And with a look so piteous in purportAs if he had been loosed out of hellTo speak of horrors,--he comes before me.LORD POLONIUSMad for thy love?OPHELIAMy lord, I do not know;But truly, I do fear it.LORD POLONIUSWhat said he?OPHELIAHe took me by the wrist and held me hard;Then goes he to the length of all his arm;And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,He falls to such perusal of my faceAs he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;At last, a little shaking of mine armAnd thrice his head thus waving up and down,He raised a sigh so piteous and profoundAs it did seem to shatter all his bulkAnd end his being: that done, he lets me go:And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;For out o' doors he went without their helps,And, to the last, bended their light on me.LORD POLONIUSCome, go with me: I will go seek the king.This is the very ecstasy of love,Whose violent property fordoes itselfAnd leads the will to desperate undertakingsAs oft as any passion under heavenThat does afflict our natures. I am sorry.What, have you given him any hard words of late?OPHELIANo, my good lord, but, as you did command,I did repel his fetters and deniedHis access to me.LORD POLONIUSThat hath made him mad.I am sorry that with better heed and judgmentI had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!By heaven, it is as proper to our ageTo cast beyond ourselves in our opinionsAs it is common for the younger sortTo lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:This must be known; which, being kept close, mightmoveMore grief to hide than hate to utter love.ExeuntSCENE II. A room in the castle.Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and AttendantsKING CLAUDIUSWelcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!Moreover that we much did long to see you,The need we have to use you did provokeOur hasty sending. Something have you heardOf Hamlet's transformation; so call it,Sith nor the exterior nor the inward manResembles that it was. What it should be,More than his father's death, that thus hath put himSo much from the understanding of himself,I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,That, being of so young days brought up with him,And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,That you vouchsafe your rest here in our courtSome little time: so by your companiesTo draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,So much as from occasion you may glean,Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,That, open'd, lies within our remedy.QUEEN GERTRUDEGood gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;And sure I am two men there are not livingTo whom he more adheres. If it will please youTo show us so much gentry and good willAs to expend your time with us awhile,For the supply and profit of our hope,Your visitation shall receive such thanksAs fits a king's remembrance.ROSENCRANTZBoth your majestiesMight, by the sovereign power you have of us,Put your dread pleasures more into commandThan to entreaty.GUILDENSTERNBut we both obey,And here give up ourselves, in the full bentTo lay our service freely at your feet,To be commanded.KING CLAUDIUSThanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.QUEEN GERTRUDEThanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:And I beseech you instantly to visitMy too much changed son. Go, some of you,And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.GUILDENSTERNHeavens make our presence and our practisesPleasant and helpful to him!QUEEN GERTRUDEAy, amen!Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some AttendantsEnter POLONIUSLORD POLONIUSThe ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,Are joyfully return'd.KING CLAUDIUSThou still hast been the father of good news.LORD POLONIUSHave I, my lord? I assure my good liege,I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,Both to my God and to my gracious king:And I do think, or else this brain of mineHunts not the trail of policy so sureAs it hath used to do, that I have foundThe very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.KING CLAUDIUSO, speak of that; that do I long to hear.LORD POLONIUSGive first admittance to the ambassadors;My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.KING CLAUDIUSThyself do grace to them, and bring them in.Exit POLONIUSHe tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath foundThe head and source of all your son's distemper.QUEEN GERTRUDEI doubt it is no other but the main;His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.KING CLAUDIUSWell, we shall sift him.Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUSWelcome, my good friends!Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?VOLTIMANDMost fair return of greetings and desires.Upon our first, he sent out to suppressHis nephew's levies; which to him appear'dTo be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;But, better look'd into, he truly foundIt was against your highness: whereat grieved,That so his sickness, age and impotenceWas falsely borne in hand, sends out arrestsOn Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fineMakes vow before his uncle never moreTo give the assay of arms against your majesty.Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,And his commission to employ those soldiers,So levied as before, against the Polack:With an entreaty, herein further shown,Giving a paperThat it might please you to give quiet passThrough your dominions for this enterprise,On such regards of safety and allowanceAs therein are set down.KING CLAUDIUSIt likes us well;And at our more consider'd time well read,Answer, and think upon this business.Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:Most welcome home!Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUSLORD POLONIUSThis business is well ended.My liege, and madam, to expostulateWhat majesty should be, what duty is,Why day is day, night night, and time is time,Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,I will be brief: your noble son is mad:Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,What is't but to be nothing else but mad?But let that go.QUEEN GERTRUDEMore matter, with less art.LORD POLONIUSMadam, I swear I use no art at all.That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;But farewell it, for I will use no art.Mad let us grant him, then: and now remainsThat we find out the cause of this effect,Or rather say, the cause of this defect,For this effect defective comes by cause:Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.I have a daughter--have while she is mine--Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.Reads'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the mostbeautified Ophelia,'--That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' isa vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:Reads'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.'QUEEN GERTRUDECame this from Hamlet to her?LORD POLONIUSGood madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.Reads'Doubt thou the stars are fire;Doubt that the sun doth move;Doubt truth to be a liar;But never doubt I love.'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;I have not art to reckon my groans: but thatI love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilstthis machine is to him, HAMLET.'This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,And more above, hath his solicitings,As they fell out by time, by means and place,All given to mine ear.KING CLAUDIUSBut how hath sheReceived his love?LORD POLONIUSWhat do you think of me?KING CLAUDIUSAs of a man faithful and honourable.LORD POLONIUSI would fain prove so. But what might you think,When I had seen this hot love on the wing--As I perceived it, I must tell you that,Before my daughter told me--what might you,Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,If I had play'd the desk or table-book,Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;What might you think? No, I went round to work,And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,That she should lock herself from his resort,Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,Into the madness wherein now he raves,And all we mourn for.KING CLAUDIUSDo you think 'tis this?QUEEN GERTRUDEIt may be, very likely.LORD POLONIUSHath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--That I have positively said 'Tis so,'When it proved otherwise?KING CLAUDIUSNot that I know.LORD POLONIUS[Pointing to his head and shoulder]Take this from this, if this be otherwise:If circumstances lead me, I will findWhere truth is hid, though it were hid indeedWithin the centre.KING CLAUDIUSHow may we try it further?LORD POLONIUSYou know, sometimes he walks four hours togetherHere in the lobby.QUEEN GERTRUDESo he does indeed.LORD POLONIUSAt such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:Be you and I behind an arras then;Mark the encounter: if he love her notAnd be not from his reason fall'n thereon,Let me be no assistant for a state,But keep a farm and carters.KING CLAUDIUSWe will try it.QUEEN GERTRUDEBut, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.LORD POLONIUSAway, I do beseech you, both away:I'll board him presently.Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and AttendantsEnter HAMLET, readingO, give me leave:How does my good Lord Hamlet?HAMLETWell, God-a-mercy.LORD POLONIUSDo you know me, my lord?HAMLETExcellent well; you are a fishmonger.LORD POLONIUSNot I, my lord.HAMLETThen I would you were so honest a man.LORD POLONIUSHonest, my lord!HAMLETAy, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to beone man picked out of ten thousand.LORD POLONIUSThat's very true, my lord.HAMLETFor if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being agod kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?LORD POLONIUSI have, my lord.HAMLETLet her not walk i' the sun: conception is ablessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.Friend, look to 't.LORD POLONIUS[Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on mydaughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said Iwas a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: andtruly in my youth I suffered much extremity forlove; very near this. I'll speak to him again.What do you read, my lord?HAMLETWords, words, words.LORD POLONIUSWhat is the matter, my lord?HAMLETBetween who?LORD POLONIUSI mean, the matter that you read, my lord.HAMLETSlanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says herethat old men have grey beards, that their faces arewrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber andplum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack ofwit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,though I most powerfully and potently believe, yetI hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, foryourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crabyou could go backward.LORD POLONIUS[Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is methodin 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?HAMLETInto my grave.LORD POLONIUSIndeed, that is out o' the air.AsideHow pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happinessthat often madness hits on, which reason and sanitycould not so prosperously be delivered of. I willleave him, and suddenly contrive the means ofmeeting between him and my daughter.--My honourablelord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.HAMLETYou cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I willmore willingly part withal: except my life, exceptmy life, except my life.LORD POLONIUSFare you well, my lord.HAMLETThese tedious old fools!Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNLORD POLONIUSYou go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.ROSENCRANTZ[To POLONIUS] God save you, sir!Exit POLONIUSGUILDENSTERNMy honoured lord!ROSENCRANTZMy most dear lord!HAMLETMy excellent good friends! How dost thou,Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?ROSENCRANTZAs the indifferent children of the earth.GUILDENSTERNHappy, in that we are not over-happy;On fortune's cap we are not the very button.HAMLETNor the soles of her shoe?ROSENCRANTZNeither, my lord.HAMLETThen you live about her waist, or in the middle ofher favours?GUILDENSTERN'Faith, her privates we.HAMLETIn the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; sheis a strumpet. What's the news?ROSENCRANTZNone, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.HAMLETThen is doomsday near: but your news is not true.Let me question more in particular: what have you,my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,that she sends you to prison hither?GUILDENSTERNPrison, my lord!HAMLETDenmark's a prison.ROSENCRANTZThen is the world one.HAMLETA goodly one; in which there are many confines,wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.ROSENCRANTZWe think not so, my lord.HAMLETWhy, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothingeither good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to meit is a prison.ROSENCRANTZWhy then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis toonarrow for your mind.HAMLETO God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and countmyself a king of infinite space, were it not that Ihave bad dreams.GUILDENSTERNWhich dreams indeed are ambition, for the verysubstance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.HAMLETA dream itself is but a shadow.ROSENCRANTZTruly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light aquality that it is but a shadow's shadow.HAMLETThen are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs andoutstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall weto the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERNWe'll wait upon you.HAMLETNo such matter: I will not sort you with the restof my servants, for, to speak to you like an honestman, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in thebeaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?ROSENCRANTZTo visit you, my lord; no other occasion.HAMLETBeggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but Ithank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks aretoo dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is ityour own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.GUILDENSTERNWhat should we say, my lord?HAMLETWhy, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sentfor; and there is a kind of confession in your lookswhich your modesties have not craft enough to colour:I know the good king and queen have sent for you.ROSENCRANTZTo what end, my lord?HAMLETThat you must teach me. But let me conjure you, bythe rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy ofour youth, by the obligation of our ever-preservedlove, and by what more dear a better proposer couldcharge you withal, be even and direct with me,whether you were sent for, or no?ROSENCRANTZ[Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?HAMLET[Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If youlove me, hold not off.GUILDENSTERNMy lord, we were sent for.HAMLETI will tell you why; so shall my anticipationprevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the kingand queen moult no feather. I have of late--butwherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone allcustom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavilywith my disposition that this goodly frame, theearth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this mostexcellent canopy, the air, look you, this braveo'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof frettedwith golden fire, why, it appears no other thing tome than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!how infinite in faculty! in form and moving howexpress and admirable! in action how like an angel!in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of theworld! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,what is this quintessence of dust? man delights notme: no, nor woman neither, though by your smilingyou seem to say so.ROSENCRANTZMy lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.HAMLETWhy did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?ROSENCRANTZTo think, my lord, if you delight not in man, whatlenten entertainment the players shall receive fromyou: we coted them on the way; and hither are theycoming, to offer you service.HAMLETHe that plays the king shall be welcome; his majestyshall have tribute of me; the adventurous knightshall use his foil and target; the lover shall notsigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his partin peace; the clown shall make those laugh whoselungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shallsay her mind freely, or the blank verse shall haltfor't. What players are they?ROSENCRANTZEven those you were wont to take delight in, thetragedians of the city.HAMLETHow chances it they travel? their residence, bothin reputation and profit, was better both ways.ROSENCRANTZI think their inhibition comes by the means of thelate innovation.HAMLETDo they hold the same estimation they did when I wasin the city? are they so followed?ROSENCRANTZNo, indeed, are they not.HAMLETHow comes it? do they grow rusty?ROSENCRANTZNay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: butthere is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,that cry out on the top of question, and are mosttyrannically clapped for't: these are now thefashion, and so berattle the common stages--so theycall them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid ofgoose-quills and dare scarce come thither.HAMLETWhat, are they children? who maintains 'em? how arethey escoted? Will they pursue the quality nolonger than they can sing? will they not sayafterwards, if they should grow themselves to commonplayers--as it is most like, if their means are nobetter--their writers do them wrong, to make themexclaim against their own succession?ROSENCRANTZ'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; andthe nation holds it no sin to tarre them tocontroversy: there was, for a while, no money bidfor argument, unless the poet and the player went tocuffs in the question.HAMLETIs't possible?GUILDENSTERNO, there has been much throwing about of brains.HAMLETDo the boys carry it away?ROSENCRANTZAy, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.HAMLETIt is not very strange; for mine uncle is king ofDenmark, and those that would make mows at him whilemy father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, anhundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.'Sblood, there is something in this more thannatural, if philosophy could find it out.Flourish of trumpets withinGUILDENSTERNThere are the players.HAMLETGentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashionand ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,must show fairly outward, should more appear likeentertainment than yours. You are welcome: but myuncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.GUILDENSTERNIn what, my dear lord?HAMLETI am but mad north-north-west: when the wind issoutherly I know a hawk from a handsaw.Enter POLONIUSLORD POLONIUSWell be with you, gentlemen!HAMLETHark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear ahearer: that great baby you see there is not yetout of his swaddling-clouts.ROSENCRANTZHappily he's the second time come to them; for theysay an old man is twice a child.HAMLETI will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;'twas so indeed.LORD POLONIUSMy lord, I have news to tell you.HAMLETMy lord, I have news to tell you.When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--LORD POLONIUSThe actors are come hither, my lord.HAMLETBuz, buz!LORD POLONIUSUpon mine honour,--HAMLETThen came each actor on his ass,--LORD POLONIUSThe best actors in the world, either for tragedy,comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, orpoem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, norPlautus too light. For the law of writ and theliberty, these are the only men.HAMLETO Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!LORD POLONIUSWhat a treasure had he, my lord?HAMLETWhy,'One fair daughter and no more,The which he loved passing well.'LORD POLONIUS[Aside] Still on my daughter.HAMLETAm I not i' the right, old Jephthah?LORD POLONIUSIf you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughterthat I love passing well.HAMLETNay, that follows not.LORD POLONIUSWhat follows, then, my lord?HAMLETWhy,'As by lot, God wot,'and then, you know,'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--the first row of the pious chanson will show youmore; for look, where my abridgement comes.Enter four or five PlayersYou are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am gladto see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my oldfriend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my younglady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship isnearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by thealtitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, likeapiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within thering. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'ento't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a tasteof your quality; come, a passionate speech.First PlayerWhat speech, my lord?HAMLETI heard thee speak me a speech once, but it wasnever acted; or, if it was, not above once; for theplay, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twascaviare to the general: but it was--as I receivedit, and others, whose judgments in such matterscried in the top of mine--an excellent play, welldigested in the scenes, set down with as muchmodesty as cunning. I remember, one said therewere no sallets in the lines to make the mattersavoury, nor no matter in the phrase that mightindict the author of affectation; but called it anhonest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by verymuch more handsome than fine. One speech in it Ichiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; andthereabout of it especially, where he speaks ofPriam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, beginat this line: let me see, let me see--'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,Black as his purpose, did the night resembleWhen he lay couched in the ominous horse,Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'dWith heraldry more dismal; head to footNow is he total gules; horridly trick'dWith blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,Baked and impasted with the parching streets,That lend a tyrannous and damned lightTo their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish PyrrhusOld grandsire Priam seeks.'So, proceed you.LORD POLONIUS'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent andgood discretion.First Player'Anon he finds himStriking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;But with the whiff and wind of his fell swordThe unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming topStoops to his base, and with a hideous crashTakes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,Which was declining on the milky headOf reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,And like a neutral to his will and matter,Did nothing.But, as we often see, against some storm,A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,The bold winds speechless and the orb belowAs hush as death, anon the dreadful thunderDoth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;And never did the Cyclops' hammers fallOn Mars's armour forged for proof eterneWith less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding swordNow falls on Priam.Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,In general synod 'take away her power;Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,As low as to the fiends!'LORD POLONIUSThis is too long.HAMLETIt shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or hesleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.First Player'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'HAMLET'The mobled queen?'LORD POLONIUSThat's good; 'mobled queen' is good.First Player'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flamesWith bisson rheum; a clout upon that headWhere late the diadem stood, and for a robe,About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,'Gainst Fortune's state would treason havepronounced:But if the gods themselves did see her thenWhen she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sportIn mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,The instant burst of clamour that she made,Unless things mortal move them not at all,Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,And passion in the gods.'LORD POLONIUSLook, whether he has not turned his colour and hastears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.HAMLET'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.Good my lord, will you see the players wellbestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; forthey are the abstract and brief chronicles of thetime: after your death you were better have a badepitaph than their ill report while you live.LORD POLONIUSMy lord, I will use them according to their desert.HAMLETGod's bodykins, man, much better: use every manafter his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?Use them after your own honour and dignity: the lessthey deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.Take them in.LORD POLONIUSCome, sirs.HAMLETFollow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the FirstDost thou hear me, old friend; can you play theMurder of Gonzago?First PlayerAy, my lord.HAMLETWe'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, whichI would set down and insert in't, could you not?First PlayerAy, my lord.HAMLETVery well. Follow that lord; and look you mock himnot.Exit First PlayerMy good friends, I'll leave you till night: you arewelcome to Elsinore.ROSENCRANTZGood my lord!HAMLETAy, so, God be wi' ye;Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNNow I am alone.O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!Is it not monstrous that this player here,But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,Could force his soul so to his own conceitThat from her working all his visage wann'd,Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,A broken voice, and his whole function suitingWith forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!For Hecuba!What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,That he should weep for her? What would he do,Had he the motive and the cue for passionThat I have? He would drown the stage with tearsAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech,Make mad the guilty and appal the free,Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeedThe very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,And can say nothing; no, not for a king,Upon whose property and most dear lifeA damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?Ha!'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot beBut I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gallTo make oppression bitter, or ere thisI should have fatted all the region kitesWith this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!O, vengeance!Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,A scullion!Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heardThat guilty creatures sitting at a playHave by the very cunning of the sceneBeen struck so to the soul that presentlyThey have proclaim'd their malefactions;For murder, though it have no tongue, will speakWith most miraculous organ. I'll have these playersPlay something like the murder of my fatherBefore mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,I know my course. The spirit that I have seenMay be the devil: and the devil hath powerTo assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhapsOut of my weakness and my melancholy,As he is very potent with such spirits,Abuses me to damn me: I'll have groundsMore relative than this: the play 's the thingWherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.ExitACT IIISCENE I. A room in the castle.Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERNKING CLAUDIUSAnd can you, by no drift of circumstance,Get from him why he puts on this confusion,Grating so harshly all his days of quietWith turbulent and dangerous lunacy?ROSENCRANTZHe does confess he feels himself distracted;But from what cause he will by no means speak.GUILDENSTERNNor do we find him forward to be sounded,But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,When we would bring him on to some confessionOf his true state.QUEEN GERTRUDEDid he receive you well?ROSENCRANTZMost like a gentleman.GUILDENSTERNBut with much forcing of his disposition.ROSENCRANTZNiggard of question; but, of our demands,Most free in his reply.QUEEN GERTRUDEDid you assay him?To any pastime?ROSENCRANTZMadam, it so fell out, that certain playersWe o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;And there did seem in him a kind of joyTo hear of it: they are about the court,And, as I think, they have already orderThis night to play before him.LORD POLONIUS'Tis most true:And he beseech'd me to entreat your majestiesTo hear and see the matter.KING CLAUDIUSWith all my heart; and it doth much content meTo hear him so inclined.Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,And drive his purpose on to these delights.ROSENCRANTZWe shall, my lord.Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNKING CLAUDIUSSweet Gertrude, leave us too;For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,That he, as 'twere by accident, may hereAffront Ophelia:Her father and myself, lawful espials,Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,We may of their encounter frankly judge,And gather by him, as he is behaved,If 't be the affliction of his love or noThat thus he suffers for.QUEEN GERTRUDEI shall obey you.And for your part, Ophelia, I do wishThat your good beauties be the happy causeOf Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtuesWill bring him to his wonted way again,To both your honours.OPHELIAMadam, I wish it may.Exit QUEEN GERTRUDELORD POLONIUSOphelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,We will bestow ourselves.To OPHELIARead on this book;That show of such an exercise may colourYour loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visageAnd pious action we do sugar o'erThe devil himself.KING CLAUDIUS[Aside] O, 'tis too true!How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,Is not more ugly to the thing that helps itThan is my deed to my most painted word:O heavy burthen!LORD POLONIUSI hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUSEnter HAMLETHAMLETTo be, or not to be, that is the question,Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to sufferThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;No more; and by a sleep to say we endThe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocksThat flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummationDevoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;For in that sleep of death what dreams may comeWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,Must give us pause: there's the respectThat makes calamity of so long life;For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,The insolence of office and the spurnsThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,When he himself might his quietus makeWith a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,To grunt and sweat under a weary life,But that the dread of something after death,The undiscover'd country from whose bournNo traveller returns, puzzles the willAnd makes us rather bear those ills we haveThan fly to others that we know not of?Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;And thus the native hue of resolutionIs sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,And enterprises of great pith and momentWith this regard their currents turn awry,And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisonsBe all my sins remember'd.OPHELIAGood my lord,How does your honour for this many a day?HAMLETI humbly thank you; well, well, well.OPHELIAMy lord, I have remembrances of yours,That I have longed long to re-deliver;I pray you, now receive them.HAMLETNo, not I;I never gave you aught.OPHELIAMy honour'd lord, you know right well you did;And, with them, words of so sweet breath composedAs made the things more rich: their perfume lost,Take these again; for to the noble mindRich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.There, my lord.HAMLETHa, ha! are you honest?OPHELIAMy lord?HAMLETAre you fair?OPHELIAWhat means your lordship?HAMLETThat if you be honest and fair, your honesty shouldadmit no discourse to your beauty.OPHELIACould beauty, my lord, have better commerce thanwith honesty?HAMLETAy, truly; for the power of beauty will soonertransform honesty from what it is to a bawd than theforce of honesty can translate beauty into hislikeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now thetime gives it proof. I did love you once.OPHELIAIndeed, my lord, you made me believe so.HAMLETYou should not have believed me; for virtue cannotso inoculate our old stock but we shall relish ofit: I loved you not.OPHELIAI was the more deceived.HAMLETGet thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be abreeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;but yet I could accuse me of such things that itwere better my mother had not borne me: I am veryproud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences atmy beck than I have thoughts to put them in,imagination to give them shape, or time to act themin. What should such fellows as I do crawlingbetween earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.Where's your father?OPHELIAAt home, my lord.HAMLETLet the doors be shut upon him, that he may play thefool no where but in's own house. Farewell.OPHELIAO, help him, you sweet heavens!HAMLETIf thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague forthy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure assnow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to anunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needsmarry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enoughwhat monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,and quickly too. Farewell.OPHELIAO heavenly powers, restore him!HAMLETI have heard of your paintings too, well enough; Godhas given you one face, and you make yourselvesanother: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, andnick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonnessyour ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hathmade me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:those that are married already, all but one, shalllive; the rest shall keep as they are. To anunnery, go.ExitOPHELIAO, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;The expectancy and rose of the fair state,The glass of fashion and the mould of form,The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,That suck'd the honey of his music vows,Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youthBlasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUSKING CLAUDIUSLove! his affections do not that way tend;Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;And I do doubt the hatch and the discloseWill be some danger: which for to prevent,I have in quick determinationThus set it down: he shall with speed to England,For the demand of our neglected tributeHaply the seas and countries differentWith variable objects shall expelThis something-settled matter in his heart,Whereon his brains still beating puts him thusFrom fashion of himself. What think you on't?LORD POLONIUSIt shall do well: but yet do I believeThe origin and commencement of his griefSprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;But, if you hold it fit, after the playLet his queen mother all alone entreat himTo show his grief: let her be round with him;And I'll be placed, so please you, in the earOf all their conference. If she find him not,To England send him, or confine him whereYour wisdom best shall think.KING CLAUDIUSIt shall be so:Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.ExeuntSCENE II. A hall in the castle.Enter HAMLET and PlayersHAMLETSpeak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it toyou, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,as many of your players do, I had as lief thetown-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the airtoo much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and begeta temperance that may give it smoothness. O, itoffends me to the soul to hear a robustiousperiwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, tovery rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, whofor the most part are capable of nothing butinexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have sucha fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; itout-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.First PlayerI warrant your honour.HAMLETBe not too tame neither, but let your own discretionbe your tutor: suit the action to the word, theword to the action; with this special o'erstep notthe modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone isfrom the purpose of playing, whose end, both at thefirst and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, themirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,scorn her own image, and the very age and body ofthe time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,or come tardy off, though it make the unskilfullaugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; thecensure of the which one must in your allowanceo'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there beplayers that I have seen play, and heard otherspraise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,that, neither having the accent of Christians northe gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have sostrutted and bellowed that I have thought some ofnature's journeymen had made men and not made themwell, they imitated humanity so abominably.First PlayerI hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,sir.HAMLETO, reform it altogether. And let those that playyour clowns speak no more than is set down for them;for there be of them that will themselves laugh, toset on some quantity of barren spectators to laughtoo; though, in the mean time, some necessaryquestion of the play be then to be considered:that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambitionin the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.Exeunt PlayersEnter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERNHow now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?LORD POLONIUSAnd the queen too, and that presently.HAMLETBid the players make haste.Exit POLONIUSWill you two help to hasten them?ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERNWe will, my lord.Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNHAMLETWhat ho! Horatio!Enter HORATIOHORATIOHere, sweet lord, at your service.HAMLETHoratio, thou art e'en as just a manAs e'er my conversation coped withal.HORATIOO, my dear lord,--HAMLETNay, do not think I flatter;For what advancement may I hope from theeThat no revenue hast but thy good spirits,To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,And crook the pregnant hinges of the kneeWhere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?Since my dear soul was mistress of her choiceAnd could of men distinguish, her electionHath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast beenAs one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,A man that fortune's buffets and rewardsHast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are thoseWhose blood and judgment are so well commingled,That they are not a pipe for fortune's fingerTo sound what stop she please. Give me that manThat is not passion's slave, and I will wear himIn my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--There is a play to-night before the king;One scene of it comes near the circumstanceWhich I have told thee of my father's death:I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,Even with the very comment of thy soulObserve mine uncle: if his occulted guiltDo not itself unkennel in one speech,It is a damned ghost that we have seen,And my imaginations are as foulAs Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,And after we will both our judgments joinIn censure of his seeming.HORATIOWell, my lord:If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.HAMLETThey are coming to the play; I must be idle:Get you a place.Danish march.

Then there'shope a great man's memory may outlive his life halfa year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, withthe hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,the hobby-horse is forgot.'Hautboys play. The dumb-show entersEnter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his loveExeuntOPHELIAWhat means this, my lord?HAMLETMarry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.OPHELIABelike this show imports the argument of the play.Enter PrologueHAMLETWe shall know by this fellow: the players cannotkeep counsel; they'll tell all.OPHELIAWill he tell us what this show meant?HAMLETAy, or any show that you'll show him: be not youashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.OPHELIAYou are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.PrologueFor us, and for our tragedy,Here stooping to your clemency,We beg your hearing patiently.ExitHAMLETIs this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?OPHELIA'Tis brief, my lord.HAMLETAs woman's love.Enter two Players, King and QueenPlayer KingFull thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone roundNeptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheenAbout the world have times twelve thirties been,Since love our hearts and Hymen did our handsUnite commutual in most sacred bands.Player QueenSo many journeys may the sun and moonMake us again count o'er ere love be done!But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,So far from cheer and from your former state,That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:For women's fear and love holds quantity;In neither aught, or in extremity.Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;And as my love is sized, my fear is so:Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.Player King'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;My operant powers their functions leave to do:And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kindFor husband shalt thou--Player QueenO, confound the rest!Such love must needs be treason in my breast:In second husband let me be accurst!None wed the second but who kill'd the first.HAMLET[Aside] Wormwood, wormwood.Player QueenThe instances that second marriage moveAre base respects of thrift, but none of love:A second time I kill my husband dead,When second husband kisses me in bed.Player KingI do believe you think what now you speak;But what we do determine oft we break.Purpose is but the slave to memory,Of violent birth, but poor validity;Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.Most necessary 'tis that we forgetTo pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:What to ourselves in passion we propose,The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.The violence of either grief or joyTheir own enactures with themselves destroy:Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strangeThat even our loves should with our fortunes change;For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;For who not needs shall never lack a friend,And who in want a hollow friend doth try,Directly seasons him his enemy.But, orderly to end where I begun,Our wills and fates do so contrary runThat our devices still are overthrown;Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:So think thou wilt no second husband wed;But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.Player QueenNor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!Sport and repose lock from me day and night!To desperation turn my trust and hope!An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!Each opposite that blanks the face of joyMeet what I would have well and it destroy!Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,If, once a widow, ever I be wife!HAMLETIf she should break it now!Player King'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguileThe tedious day with sleep.SleepsPlayer QueenSleep rock thy brain,And never come mischance between us twain!ExitHAMLETMadam, how like you this play?QUEEN GERTRUDEThe lady protests too much, methinks.HAMLETO, but she'll keep her word.KING CLAUDIUSHave you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?HAMLETNo, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offencei' the world.KING CLAUDIUSWhat do you call the play?HAMLETThe Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This playis the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago isthe duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall seeanon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'that? your majesty and we that have free souls, ittouches us not: let the galled jade wince, ourwithers are unwrung.Enter LUCIANUSThis is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.OPHELIAYou are as good as a chorus, my lord.HAMLETI could interpret between you and your love, if Icould see the puppets dallying.OPHELIAYou are keen, my lord, you are keen.HAMLETIt would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.OPHELIAStill better, and worse.HAMLETSo you must take your husbands.

Come:'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'LUCIANUSThoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;Confederate season, else no creature seeing;Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,Thy natural magic and dire property,On wholesome life usurp immediately.Pours the poison into the sleeper's earsHAMLETHe poisons him i' the garden for's estate. Hisname's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ inchoice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderergets the love of Gonzago's wife.OPHELIAThe king rises.HAMLETWhat, frighted with false fire!QUEEN GERTRUDEHow fares my lord?LORD POLONIUSGive o'er the play.KING CLAUDIUSGive me some light: away!AllLights, lights, lights!Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIOHAMLETWhy, let the stricken deer go weep,The hart ungalled play;For some must watch, while some must sleep:So runs the world away.Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- ifthe rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with twoProvincial roses on my razed shoes, get me afellowship in a cry of players, sir?HORATIOHalf a share.HAMLETA whole one, I.For thou dost know, O Damon dear,This realm dismantled wasOf Jove himself; and now reigns hereA very, very--pajock.HORATIOYou might have rhymed.HAMLETO good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for athousand pound.

Haveyou any further trade with us?ROSENCRANTZMy lord, you once did love me.HAMLETSo I do still, by these pickers and stealers.ROSENCRANTZGood my lord, what is your cause of distemper? youdo, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, ifyou deny your griefs to your friend.HAMLETSir, I lack advancement.ROSENCRANTZHow can that be, when you have the voice of the kinghimself for your succession in Denmark?HAMLETAy, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverbis something musty.Re-enter Players with recordersO, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw withyou:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,as if you would drive me into a toil?GUILDENSTERNO, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is toounmannerly.HAMLETI do not well understand that. Will you play uponthis pipe?GUILDENSTERNMy lord, I cannot.HAMLETI pray you.GUILDENSTERNBelieve me, I cannot.HAMLETI do beseech you.GUILDENSTERNI know no touch of it, my lord.HAMLET'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages withyour lingers and thumb, give it breath with yourmouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.Look you, these are the stops.GUILDENSTERNBut these cannot I command to any utterance ofharmony; I have not the skill.HAMLETWhy, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make ofme! You would play upon me; you would seem to knowmy stops; you would pluck out the heart of mymystery; you would sound me from my lowest note tothe top of my compass: and there is much music,excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannotyou make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I ameasier to be played on than a pipe? Call me whatinstrument you will, though you can fret me, yet youcannot play upon me.Enter POLONIUSGod bless you, sir!LORD POLONIUSMy lord, the queen would speak with you, andpresently.HAMLETDo you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?LORD POLONIUSBy the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.HAMLETMethinks it is like a weasel.LORD POLONIUSIt is backed like a weasel.HAMLETOr like a whale?LORD POLONIUSVery like a whale.HAMLETThen I will come to my mother by and by. They foolme to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.LORD POLONIUSI will say so.HAMLETBy and by is easily said.Exit POLONIUSLeave me, friends.Exeunt all but HAMLETTis now the very witching time of night,When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes outContagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,And do such bitter business as the dayWould quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.O heart, lose not thy nature; let not everThe soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:Let me be cruel, not unnatural:I will speak daggers to her, but use none;My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;How in my words soever she be shent,To give them seals never, my soul, consent!ExitSCENE III. A room in the castle.Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERNKING CLAUDIUSI like him not, nor stands it safe with usTo let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;I your commission will forthwith dispatch,And he to England shall along with you:The terms of our estate may not endureHazard so dangerous as doth hourly growOut of his lunacies.GUILDENSTERNWe will ourselves provide:Most holy and religious fear it isTo keep those many many bodies safeThat live and feed upon your majesty.ROSENCRANTZThe single and peculiar life is bound,With all the strength and armour of the mind,To keep itself from noyance; but much moreThat spirit upon whose weal depend and restThe lives of many. The cease of majestyDies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth drawWhat's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser thingsAre mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,Each small annexment, petty consequence,Attends the boisterous ruin. Never aloneDid the king sigh, but with a general groan.KING CLAUDIUSArm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;For we will fetters put upon this fear,Which now goes too free-footed.ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERNWe will haste us.Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNEnter POLONIUSLORD POLONIUSMy lord, he's going to his mother's closet:Behind the arras I'll convey myself,To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:And, as you said, and wisely was it said,'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhearThe speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,And tell you what I know.KING CLAUDIUSThanks, dear my lord.Exit POLONIUSO, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,A brother's murder. Pray can I not,Though inclination be as sharp as will:My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;And, like a man to double business bound,I stand in pause where I shall first begin,And both neglect. What if this cursed handWere thicker than itself with brother's blood,Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavensTo wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercyBut to confront the visage of offence?And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,To be forestalled ere we come to fall,Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayerCan serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?That cannot be; since I am still possess'dOf those effects for which I did the murder,My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?In the corrupted currents of this worldOffence's gilded hand may shove by justice,And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itselfBuys out the law: but 'tis not so above;There is no shuffling, there the action liesIn his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,To give in evidence. What then? what rests?Try what repentance can: what can it not?Yet what can it when one can not repent?O wretched state! O bosom black as death!O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!All may be well.Retires and kneelsEnter HAMLETHAMLETNow might I do it pat, now he is praying;And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:A villain kills my father; and for that,I, his sole son, do this same villain sendTo heaven.O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.He took my father grossly, full of bread;With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?But in our circumstance and course of thought,'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,To take him in the purging of his soul,When he is fit and season'd for his passage?No!Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;At gaming, swearing, or about some actThat has no relish of salvation in't;Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,And that his soul may be as damn'd and blackAs hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.ExitKING CLAUDIUS[Rising] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:Words without thoughts never to heaven go.ExitSCENE IV. The Queen's closet.Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE and POLONIUSLORD POLONIUSHe will come straight. Look you lay home to him:Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,And that your grace hath screen'd and stood betweenMuch heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.Pray you, be round with him.HAMLET[Within] Mother, mother, mother!QUEEN GERTRUDEI'll warrant you,Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.POLONIUS hides behind the arrasEnter HAMLETHAMLETNow, mother, what's the matter?QUEEN GERTRUDEHamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.HAMLETMother, you have my father much offended.QUEEN GERTRUDECome, come, you answer with an idle tongue.HAMLETGo, go, you question with a wicked tongue.QUEEN GERTRUDEWhy, how now, Hamlet!HAMLETWhat's the matter now?QUEEN GERTRUDEHave you forgot me?HAMLETNo, by the rood, not so:You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.QUEEN GERTRUDENay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.HAMLETCome, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;You go not till I set you up a glassWhere you may see the inmost part of you.QUEEN GERTRUDEWhat wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?Help, help, ho!LORD POLONIUS[Behind] What, ho! help, help, help!HAMLET[Drawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!Makes a pass through the arrasLORD POLONIUS[Behind] O, I am slain!Falls and diesQUEEN GERTRUDEO me, what hast thou done?HAMLETNay, I know not:Is it the king?QUEEN GERTRUDEO, what a rash and bloody deed is this!HAMLETA bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,As kill a king, and marry with his brother.QUEEN GERTRUDEAs kill a king!HAMLETAy, lady, 'twas my word.Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUSThou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,If it be made of penetrable stuff,If damned custom have not brass'd it soThat it is proof and bulwark against sense.QUEEN GERTRUDEWhat have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongueIn noise so rude against me?HAMLETSuch an actThat blurs the grace and blush of modesty,Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the roseFrom the fair forehead of an innocent loveAnd sets a blister there, makes marriage-vowsAs false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deedAs from the body of contraction plucksThe very soul, and sweet religion makesA rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:Yea, this solidity and compound mass,With tristful visage, as against the doom,Is thought-sick at the act.QUEEN GERTRUDEAy me, what act,That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?HAMLETLook here, upon this picture, and on this,The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.See, what a grace was seated on this brow;Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;A station like the herald MercuryNew-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;A combination and a form indeed,Where every god did seem to set his seal,To give the world assurance of a man:This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?You cannot call it love; for at your ageThe hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,And waits upon the judgment: and what judgmentWould step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,Else could you not have motion; but sure, that senseIs apoplex'd; for madness would not err,Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'dBut it reserved some quantity of choice,To serve in such a difference. What devil was'tThat thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,Or but a sickly part of one true senseCould not so mope.O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shameWhen the compulsive ardour gives the charge,Since frost itself as actively doth burnAnd reason panders will.QUEEN GERTRUDEO Hamlet, speak no more:Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;And there I see such black and grained spotsAs will not leave their tinct.HAMLETNay, but to liveIn the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making loveOver the nasty sty,--QUEEN GERTRUDEO, speak to me no more;These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;No more, sweet Hamlet!HAMLETA murderer and a villain;A slave that is not twentieth part the titheOf your precedent lord; a vice of kings;A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,And put it in his pocket!QUEEN GERTRUDENo more!HAMLETA king of shreds and patches,--Enter GhostSave me, and hover o'er me with your wings,You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?QUEEN GERTRUDEAlas, he's mad!HAMLETDo you not come your tardy son to chide,That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go byThe important acting of your dread command? O, say!GhostDo not forget: this visitationIs but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:O, step between her and her fighting soul:Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:Speak to her, Hamlet.HAMLETHow is it with you, lady?QUEEN GERTRUDEAlas, how is't with you,That you do bend your eye on vacancyAnd with the incorporal air do hold discourse?Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,Upon the heat and flame of thy distemperSprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?HAMLETOn him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;Lest with this piteous action you convertMy stern effects: then what I have to doWill want true colour; tears perchance for blood.QUEEN GERTRUDETo whom do you speak this?HAMLETDo you see nothing there?QUEEN GERTRUDENothing at all; yet all that is I see.HAMLETNor did you nothing hear?QUEEN GERTRUDENo, nothing but ourselves.HAMLETWhy, look you there! look, how it steals away!My father, in his habit as he lived!Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!Exit GhostQUEEN GERTRUDEThis the very coinage of your brain:This bodiless creation ecstasyIs very cunning in.HAMLETEcstasy!My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,And makes as healthful music: it is not madnessThat I have utter'd: bring me to the test,And I the matter will re-word; which madnessWould gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;And do not spread the compost on the weeds,To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;For in the fatness of these pursy timesVirtue itself of vice must pardon beg,Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.QUEEN GERTRUDEO Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.HAMLETO, throw away the worser part of it,And live the purer with the other half.Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;Assume a virtue, if you have it not.That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,That to the use of actions fair and goodHe likewise gives a frock or livery,That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,And that shall lend a kind of easinessTo the next abstinence: the next more easy;For use almost can change the stamp of nature,And either [ ] the devil, or throw him outWith wondrous potency. Once more, good night:And when you are desirous to be bless'd,I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,Pointing to POLONIUSI do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,To punish me with this and this with me,That I must be their scourge and minister.I will bestow him, and will answer wellThe death I gave him. So, again, good night.I must be cruel, only to be kind:Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.One word more, good lady.QUEEN GERTRUDEWhat shall I do?HAMLETNot this, by no means, that I bid you do:Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,Make you to ravel all this matter out,That I essentially am not in madness,But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?No, in despite of sense and secrecy,Unpeg the basket on the house's top.Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,To try conclusions, in the basket creep,And break your own neck down.QUEEN GERTRUDEBe thou assured, if words be made of breath,And breath of life, I have no life to breatheWhat thou hast said to me.HAMLETI must to England; you know that?QUEEN GERTRUDEAlack,I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.HAMLETThere's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;For 'tis the sport to have the engineerHoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hardBut I will delve one yard below their mines,And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,When in one line two crafts directly meet.This man shall set me packing:I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellorIs now most still, most secret and most grave,Who was in life a foolish prating knave.Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.Good night, mother.Exeunt severally; HAMLET dragging in POLONIUSACT IVSCENE I. A room in the castle.Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERNKING CLAUDIUSThere's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.Where is your son?QUEEN GERTRUDEBestow this place on us a little while.Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNAh, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!KING CLAUDIUSWhat, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?QUEEN GERTRUDEMad as the sea and wind, when both contendWhich is the mightier: in his lawless fit,Behind the arras hearing something stir,Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'And, in this brainish apprehension, killsThe unseen good old man.KING CLAUDIUSO heavy deed!It had been so with us, had we been there:His liberty is full of threats to all;To you yourself, to us, to every one.Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?It will be laid to us, whose providenceShould have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,This mad young man: but so much was our love,We would not understand what was most fit;But, like the owner of a foul disease,To keep it from divulging, let it feedEven on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?QUEEN GERTRUDETo draw apart the body he hath kill'd:O'er whom his very madness, like some oreAmong a mineral of metals base,Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.KING CLAUDIUSO Gertrude, come away!The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,But we will ship him hence: and this vile deedWe must, with all our majesty and skill,Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNFriends both, go join you with some further aid:Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the bodyInto the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNCome, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;And let them know, both what we mean to do,And what's untimely done. O, come away!My soul is full of discord and dismay.ExeuntSCENE II. Another room in the castle.Enter HAMLETHAMLETSafely stowed.ROSENCRANTZ: GUILDENSTERN:[Within] Hamlet!

But such officers do theking best service in the end: he keeps them, likean ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, tobe last swallowed: when he needs what you havegleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, youshall be dry again.ROSENCRANTZI understand you not, my lord.HAMLETI am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in afoolish ear.ROSENCRANTZMy lord, you must tell us where the body is, and gowith us to the king.HAMLETThe body is with the king, but the king is not withthe body. The king is a thing--GUILDENSTERNA thing, my lord!HAMLETOf nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.ExeuntSCENE III. Another room in the castle.Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attendedKING CLAUDIUSI have sent to seek him, and to find the body.How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!Yet must not we put the strong law on him:He's loved of the distracted multitude,Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,This sudden sending him away must seemDeliberate pause: diseases desperate grownBy desperate appliance are relieved,Or not at all.Enter ROSENCRANTZHow now! what hath befall'n?ROSENCRANTZWhere the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,We cannot get from him.KING CLAUDIUSBut where is he?ROSENCRANTZWithout, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.KING CLAUDIUSBring him before us.ROSENCRANTZHo, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERNKING CLAUDIUSNow, Hamlet, where's Polonius?HAMLETAt supper.KING CLAUDIUSAt supper! where?HAMLETNot where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certainconvocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Yourworm is your only emperor for diet: we fat allcreatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves formaggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is butvariable service, two dishes, but to one table:that's the end.KING CLAUDIUSAlas, alas!HAMLETA man may fish with the worm that hath eat of aking, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.KING CLAUDIUSWhat dost you mean by this?HAMLETNothing but to show you how a king may go aprogress through the guts of a beggar.KING CLAUDIUSWhere is Polonius?HAMLETIn heaven; send hither to see: if your messengerfind him not there, seek him i' the other placeyourself. But indeed, if you find him not withinthis month, you shall nose him as you go up thestairs into the lobby.KING CLAUDIUSGo seek him there.To some AttendantsHAMLETHe will stay till ye come.Exeunt AttendantsKING CLAUDIUSHamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--Which we do tender, as we dearly grieveFor that which thou hast done,--must send thee henceWith fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;The bark is ready, and the wind at help,The associates tend, and every thing is bentFor England.HAMLETFor England!KING CLAUDIUSAy, Hamlet.HAMLETGood.KING CLAUDIUSSo is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.HAMLETI see a cherub that sees them. But, come; forEngland! Farewell, dear mother.KING CLAUDIUSThy loving father, Hamlet.HAMLETMy mother: father and mother is man and wife; manand wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!ExitKING CLAUDIUSFollow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:Away! for every thing is seal'd and doneThat else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNAnd, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--As my great power thereof may give thee sense,Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and redAfter the Danish sword, and thy free awePays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly setOur sovereign process; which imports at full,By letters congruing to that effect,The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;For like the hectic in my blood he rages,And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.ExitSCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.Enter FORTINBRAS, a Captain, and Soldiers, marchingPRINCE FORTINBRASGo, captain, from me greet the Danish king;Tell him that, by his licence, FortinbrasCraves the conveyance of a promised marchOver his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.If that his majesty would aught with us,We shall express our duty in his eye;And let him know so.CaptainI will do't, my lord.PRINCE FORTINBRASGo softly on.Exeunt FORTINBRAS and SoldiersEnter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and othersHAMLETGood sir, whose powers are these?CaptainThey are of Norway, sir.HAMLETHow purposed, sir, I pray you?CaptainAgainst some part of Poland.HAMLETWho commands them, sir?CaptainThe nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.HAMLETGoes it against the main of Poland, sir,Or for some frontier?CaptainTruly to speak, and with no addition,We go to gain a little patch of groundThat hath in it no profit but the name.To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;Nor will it yield to Norway or the PoleA ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.HAMLETWhy, then the Polack never will defend it.CaptainYes, it is already garrison'd.HAMLETTwo thousand souls and twenty thousand ducatsWill not debate the question of this straw:This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,That inward breaks, and shows no cause withoutWhy the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.CaptainGod be wi' you, sir.ExitROSENCRANTZWilt please you go, my lord?HAMLETI'll be with you straight go a little before.Exeunt all except HAMLETHow all occasions do inform against me,And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,If his chief good and market of his timeBe but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,Looking before and after, gave us notThat capability and god-like reasonTo fust in us unused. Now, whether it beBestial oblivion, or some craven scrupleOf thinking too precisely on the event,A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdomAnd ever three parts coward, I do not knowWhy yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'Sith I have cause and will and strength and meansTo do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:Witness this army of such mass and chargeLed by a delicate and tender prince,Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'dMakes mouths at the invisible event,Exposing what is mortal and unsureTo all that fortune, death and danger dare,Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be greatIs not to stir without great argument,But greatly to find quarrel in a strawWhen honour's at the stake. How stand I then,That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,Excitements of my reason and my blood,And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I seeThe imminent death of twenty thousand men,That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plotWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause,Which is not tomb enough and continentTo hide the slain? O, from this time forth,My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!ExitSCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the castle.Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a GentlemanQUEEN GERTRUDEI will not speak with her.GentlemanShe is importunate, indeed distract:Her mood will needs be pitied.QUEEN GERTRUDEWhat would she have?GentlemanShe speaks much of her father; says she hearsThere's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,Yet the unshaped use of it doth moveThe hearers to collection; they aim at it,And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;Which, as her winks, and nods, and gesturesyield them,Indeed would make one think there might be thought,Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.HORATIO'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strewDangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.QUEEN GERTRUDELet her come in.Exit HORATIOTo my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:So full of artless jealousy is guilt,It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.Re-enter HORATIO, with OPHELIAOPHELIAWhere is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?QUEEN GERTRUDEHow now, Ophelia!OPHELIA[Sings]How should I your true love knowFrom another one?By his cockle hat and staff,And his sandal shoon.QUEEN GERTRUDEAlas, sweet lady, what imports this song?OPHELIASay you? nay, pray you, mark.SingsHe is dead and gone, lady,He is dead and gone;At his head a grass-green turf,At his heels a stone.QUEEN GERTRUDENay, but, Ophelia,--OPHELIAPray you, mark.SingsWhite his shroud as the mountain snow,--Enter KING CLAUDIUSQUEEN GERTRUDEAlas, look here, my lord.OPHELIA[Sings]Larded with sweet flowersWhich bewept to the grave did goWith true-love showers.KING CLAUDIUSHow do you, pretty lady?OPHELIAWell, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker'sdaughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know notwhat we may be. God be at your table!KING CLAUDIUSConceit upon her father.OPHELIAPray you, let's have no words of this; but when theyask you what it means, say you this:SingsTo-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,All in the morning betime,And I a maid at your window,To be your Valentine.Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,And dupp'd the chamber-door;Let in the maid, that out a maidNever departed more.KING CLAUDIUSPretty Ophelia!OPHELIAIndeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:SingsBy Gis and by Saint Charity,Alack, and fie for shame!Young men will do't, if they come to't;By cock, they are to blame.Quoth she, before you tumbled me,You promised me to wed.So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,An thou hadst not come to my bed.KING CLAUDIUSHow long hath she been thus?OPHELIAI hope all will be well. We must be patient: but Icannot choose but weep, to think they should lay himi' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, mycoach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;good night, good night.ExitKING CLAUDIUSFollow her close; give her good watch,I pray you.Exit HORATIOO, this is the poison of deep grief; it springsAll from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,When sorrows come, they come not single spiesBut in battalions. First, her father slain:Next, your son gone; and he most violent authorOf his own just remove: the people muddied,Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor OpheliaDivided from herself and her fair judgment,Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:Last, and as much containing as all these,Her brother is in secret come from France;Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,And wants not buzzers to infect his earWith pestilent speeches of his father's death;Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,Will nothing stick our person to arraignIn ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,Like to a murdering-piece, in many placesGives me superfluous death.A noise withinQUEEN GERTRUDEAlack, what noise is this?KING CLAUDIUSWhere are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.Enter another GentlemanWhat is the matter?GentlemanSave yourself, my lord:The ocean, overpeering of his list,Eats not the flats with more impetuous hasteThan young Laertes, in a riotous head,O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;And, as the world were now but to begin,Antiquity forgot, custom not known,The ratifiers and props of every word,They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'QUEEN GERTRUDEHow cheerfully on the false trail they cry!O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!KING CLAUDIUSThe doors are broke.Noise withinEnter LAERTES, armed; Danes followingLAERTESWhere is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.DanesNo, let's come in.LAERTESI pray you, give me leave.DanesWe will, we will.They retire without the doorLAERTESI thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,Give me my father!QUEEN GERTRUDECalmly, good Laertes.LAERTESThat drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlotEven here, between the chaste unsmirched browOf my true mother.KING CLAUDIUSWhat is the cause, Laertes,That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:There's such divinity doth hedge a king,That treason can but peep to what it would,Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.Speak, man.LAERTESWhere is my father?KING CLAUDIUSDead.QUEEN GERTRUDEBut not by him.KING CLAUDIUSLet him demand his fill.LAERTESHow came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!I dare damnation. To this point I stand,That both the worlds I give to negligence,Let come what comes; only I'll be revengedMost thoroughly for my father.KING CLAUDIUSWho shall stay you?LAERTESMy will, not all the world:And for my means, I'll husband them so well,They shall go far with little.KING CLAUDIUSGood Laertes,If you desire to know the certaintyOf your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,Winner and loser?LAERTESNone but his enemies.KING CLAUDIUSWill you know them then?LAERTESTo his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;And like the kind life-rendering pelican,Repast them with my blood.KING CLAUDIUSWhy, now you speakLike a good child and a true gentleman.That I am guiltless of your father's death,And am most sensible in grief for it,It shall as level to your judgment pierceAs day does to your eye.Danes[Within] Let her come in.LAERTESHow now! what noise is that?Re-enter OPHELIAO heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's witsShould be as moral as an old man's life?Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,It sends some precious instance of itselfAfter the thing it loves.OPHELIA[Sings]They bore him barefaced on the bier;Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--Fare you well, my dove!LAERTESHadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,It could not move thus.OPHELIA[Sings]You must sing a-down a-down,An you call him a-down-a.O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the falsesteward, that stole his master's daughter.LAERTESThis nothing's more than matter.OPHELIAThere's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.LAERTESA document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.OPHELIAThere's fennel for you, and columbines: there's ruefor you; and here's some for me: we may call itherb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue witha difference. There's a daisy: I would give yousome violets, but they withered all when my fatherdied: they say he made a good end,--SingsFor bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.LAERTESThought and affliction, passion, hell itself,She turns to favour and to prettiness.OPHELIA[Sings]And will he not come again?And will he not come again?No, no, he is dead:Go to thy death-bed:He never will come again.His beard was as white as snow,All flaxen was his poll:He is gone, he is gone,And we cast away moan:God ha' mercy on his soul!And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.ExitLAERTESDo you see this, O God?KING CLAUDIUSLaertes, I must commune with your grief,Or you deny me right. Go but apart,Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:If by direct or by collateral handThey find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,To you in satisfaction; but if not,Be you content to lend your patience to us,And we shall jointly labour with your soulTo give it due content.LAERTESLet this be so;His means of death, his obscure funeral--No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,No noble rite nor formal ostentation--Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,That I must call't in question.KING CLAUDIUSSo you shall;And where the offence is let the great axe fall.I pray you, go with me.ExeuntSCENE VI. Another room in the castle.Enter HORATIO and a ServantHORATIOWhat are they that would speak with me?ServantSailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.HORATIOLet them come in.Exit ServantI do not know from what part of the worldI should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.Enter SailorsFirst SailorGod bless you, sir.HORATIOLet him bless thee too.First SailorHe shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter foryou, sir; it comes from the ambassador that wasbound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I amlet to know it is.HORATIO[Reads] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlookedthis, give these fellows some means to the king:they have letters for him. Ere we were two days oldat sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave uschase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put ona compelled valour, and in the grapple I boardedthem: on the instant they got clear of our ship; soI alone became their prisoner. They have dealt withme like thieves of mercy: but they knew what theydid; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the kinghave the letters I have sent; and repair thou to mewith as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. Ihave words to speak in thine ear will make theedumb; yet are they much too light for the bore ofthe matter. These good fellows will bring theewhere I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold theircourse for England: of them I have much to tellthee. Farewell.'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'Come, I will make you way for these your letters;And do't the speedier, that you may direct meTo him from whom you brought them.ExeuntSCENE VII. Another room in the castle.Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTESKING CLAUDIUSNow must your conscience my acquaintance seal,And you must put me in your heart for friend,Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,That he which hath your noble father slainPursued my life.LAERTESIt well appears: but tell meWhy you proceeded not against these feats,So crimeful and so capital in nature,As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,You mainly were stirr'd up.KING CLAUDIUSO, for two special reasons;Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,But yet to me they are strong. The queen his motherLives almost by his looks; and for myself--My virtue or my plague, be it either which--She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,I could not but by her. The other motive,Why to a public count I might not go,Is the great love the general gender bear him;Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,Would have reverted to my bow again,And not where I had aim'd them.LAERTESAnd so have I a noble father lost;A sister driven into desperate terms,Whose worth, if praises may go back again,Stood challenger on mount of all the ageFor her perfections: but my revenge will come.KING CLAUDIUSBreak not your sleeps for that: you must not thinkThat we are made of stuff so flat and dullThat we can let our beard be shook with dangerAnd think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:I loved your father, and we love ourself;And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--Enter a MessengerHow now! what news?MessengerLetters, my lord, from Hamlet:This to your majesty; this to the queen.KING CLAUDIUSFrom Hamlet! who brought them?MessengerSailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:They were given me by Claudio; he received themOf him that brought them.KING CLAUDIUSLaertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.Exit MessengerReads'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked onyour kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to seeyour kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking yourpardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my suddenand more strange return. 'HAMLET.'What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?LAERTESKnow you the hand?KING CLAUDIUS'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'Can you advise me?LAERTESI'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;It warms the very sickness in my heart,That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,'Thus didest thou.'KING CLAUDIUSIf it be so, Laertes--As how should it be so? how otherwise?--Will you be ruled by me?LAERTESAy, my lord;So you will not o'errule me to a peace.KING CLAUDIUSTo thine own peace. If he be now return'd,As checking at his voyage, and that he meansNo more to undertake it, I will work himTo an exploit, now ripe in my device,Under the which he shall not choose but fall:And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,But even his mother shall uncharge the practiseAnd call it accident.LAERTESMy lord, I will be ruled;The rather, if you could devise it soThat I might be the organ.KING CLAUDIUSIt falls right.You have been talk'd of since your travel much,And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a qualityWherein, they say, you shine: your sum of partsDid not together pluck such envy from himAs did that one, and that, in my regard,Of the unworthiest siege.LAERTESWhat part is that, my lord?KING CLAUDIUSA very riband in the cap of youth,Yet needful too; for youth no less becomesThe light and careless livery that it wearsThan settled age his sables and his weeds,Importing health and graveness. Two months since,Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--I've seen myself, and served against, the French,And they can well on horseback: but this gallantHad witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,As he had been incorpsed and demi-naturedWith the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,Come short of what he did.LAERTESA Norman was't?KING CLAUDIUSA Norman.LAERTESUpon my life, Lamond.KING CLAUDIUSThe very same.LAERTESI know him well: he is the brooch indeedAnd gem of all the nation.KING CLAUDIUSHe made confession of you,And gave you such a masterly reportFor art and exercise in your defenceAnd for your rapier most especially,That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,If you opposed them. Sir, this report of hisDid Hamlet so envenom with his envyThat he could nothing do but wish and begYour sudden coming o'er, to play with him.Now, out of this,--LAERTESWhat out of this, my lord?KING CLAUDIUSLaertes, was your father dear to you?Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,A face without a heart?LAERTESWhy ask you this?KING CLAUDIUSNot that I think you did not love your father;But that I know love is begun by time;And that I see, in passages of proof,Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.There lives within the very flame of loveA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;And nothing is at a like goodness still;For goodness, growing to a plurisy,Dies in his own too much: that we would doWe should do when we would; for this 'would' changesAnd hath abatements and delays as manyAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,To show yourself your father's son in deedMore than in words?LAERTESTo cut his throat i' the church.KING CLAUDIUSNo place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:We'll put on those shall praise your excellenceAnd set a double varnish on the fameThe Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine togetherAnd wager on your heads: he, being remiss,Most generous and free from all contriving,Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,Or with a little shuffling, you may chooseA sword unbated, and in a pass of practiseRequite him for your father.LAERTESI will do't:And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.I bought an unction of a mountebank,So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,Collected from all simples that have virtueUnder the moon, can save the thing from deathThat is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my pointWith this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,It may be death.KING CLAUDIUSLet's further think of this;Weigh what convenience both of time and meansMay fit us to our shape: if this should fail,And that our drift look through our bad performance,'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this projectShould have a back or second, that might hold,If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.When in your motion you are hot and dry--As make your bouts more violent to that end--And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared himA chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,Our purpose may hold there.Enter QUEEN GERTRUDEHow now, sweet queen!QUEEN GERTRUDEOne woe doth tread upon another's heel,So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.LAERTESDrown'd! O, where?QUEEN GERTRUDEThere is a willow grows aslant a brook,That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;There with fantastic garlands did she comeOf crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purplesThat liberal shepherds give a grosser name,But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weedsClambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;When down her weedy trophies and herselfFell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;As one incapable of her own distress,Or like a creature native and induedUnto that element: but long it could not beTill that her garments, heavy with their drink,Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious layTo muddy death.LAERTESAlas, then, she is drown'd?QUEEN GERTRUDEDrown'd, drown'd.LAERTESToo much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,And therefore I forbid my tears: but yetIt is our trick; nature her custom holds,Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,But that this folly douts it.ExitKING CLAUDIUSLet's follow, Gertrude:How much I had to do to calm his rage!Now fear I this will give it start again;Therefore let's follow.ExeuntACT VSCENE I. A churchyard.Enter two Clowns, with spades, & cFirst ClownIs she to be buried in Christian burial thatwilfully seeks her own salvation?Second ClownI tell thee she is: and therefore make her gravestraight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds itChristian burial.First ClownHow can that be, unless she drowned herself in herown defence?Second ClownWhy, 'tis found so.First ClownIt must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. Forhere lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: itis, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drownedherself wittingly.Second ClownNay, but hear you, goodman delver,--First ClownGive me leave. Here lies the water; good: herestands the man; good; if the man go to this water,and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, hegoes,--mark you that; but if the water come to himand drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, hethat is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.Second ClownBut is this law?First ClownAy, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.Second ClownWill you ha' the truth on't? If this had not beena gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'Christian burial.First ClownWhy, there thou say'st: and the more pity thatgreat folk should have countenance in this world todrown or hang themselves, more than their evenChristian. Come, my spade. There is no ancientgentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:they hold up Adam's profession.Second ClownWas he a gentleman?First ClownHe was the first that ever bore arms.Second ClownWhy, he had none.First ClownWhat, art a heathen? How dost thou understand theScripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'could he dig without arms? I'll put anotherquestion to thee: if thou answerest me not to thepurpose, confess thyself--Second ClownGo to.First ClownWhat is he that builds stronger than either themason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?Second ClownThe gallows-maker; for that frame outlives athousand tenants.First ClownI like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallowsdoes well; but how does it well? it does well tothose that do in: now thou dost ill to say thegallows is built stronger than the church: argal,the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.Second Clown'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, ora carpenter?'First ClownAy, tell me that, and unyoke.Second ClownMarry, now I can tell.First ClownTo't.Second ClownMass, I cannot tell.Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distanceFirst ClownCudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dullass will not mend his pace with beating; and, whenyou are asked this question next, say 'agrave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last tilldoomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me astoup of liquor.Exit Second ClownHe digs and singsIn youth, when I did love, did love,Methought it was very sweet,To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,O, methought, there was nothing meet.HAMLETHas this fellow no feeling of his business, that hesings at grave-making?HORATIOCustom hath made it in him a property of easiness.HAMLET'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment haththe daintier sense.First Clown[Sings]But age, with his stealing steps,Hath claw'd me in his clutch,And hath shipped me intil the land,As if I had never been such.Throws up a skullHAMLETThat skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it wereCain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! Itmight be the pate of a politician, which this assnow o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,might it not?HORATIOIt might, my lord.HAMLETOr of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This mightbe my lord such-a-one, that praised my lordsuch-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?HORATIOAy, my lord.HAMLETWhy, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, andknocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:here's fine revolution, an we had the trick tosee't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.First Clown[Sings]A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,For and a shrouding sheet:O, a pit of clay for to be madeFor such a guest is meet.Throws up another skullHAMLETThere's another: why may not that be the skull of alawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does hesuffer this rude knave now to knock him about thesconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him ofhis action of battery? Hum! This fellow might bein's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, andthe recovery of his recoveries, to have his finepate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch himno more of his purchases, and double ones too, thanthe length and breadth of a pair of indentures? Thevery conveyances of his lands will hardly lie inthis box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?HORATIONot a jot more, my lord.HAMLETIs not parchment made of sheepskins?HORATIOAy, my lord, and of calf-skins too.HAMLETThey are sheep and calves which seek out assurancein that. I will speak to this fellow. Whosegrave's this, sirrah?First ClownMine, sir.SingsO, a pit of clay for to be madeFor such a guest is meet.HAMLETI think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.First ClownYou lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is notyours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.HAMLET'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.First Clown'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me toyou.HAMLETWhat man dost thou dig it for?First ClownFor no man, sir.HAMLETWhat woman, then?First ClownFor none, neither.HAMLETWho is to be buried in't?First ClownOne that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.HAMLETHow absolute the knave is! we must speak by thecard, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,Horatio, these three years I have taken a note ofit; the age is grown so picked that the toe of thepeasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, hegaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been agrave-maker?First ClownOf all the days i' the year, I came to't that daythat our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.HAMLETHow long is that since?First ClownCannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: itwas the very day that young Hamlet was born; he thatis mad, and sent into England.HAMLETAy, marry, why was he sent into England?First ClownWhy, because he was mad: he shall recover his witsthere; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.HAMLETWhy?First Clown'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the menare as mad as he.HAMLETHow came he mad?First ClownVery strangely, they say.HAMLETHow strangely?First ClownFaith, e'en with losing his wits.HAMLETUpon what ground?First ClownWhy, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, manand boy, thirty years.HAMLETHow long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?First ClownI' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as wehave many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarcehold the laying in--he will last you some eight yearor nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.HAMLETWhy he more than another?First ClownWhy, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, thathe will keep out water a great while; and your wateris a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earththree and twenty years.HAMLETWhose was it?First ClownA whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?HAMLETNay, I know not.First ClownA pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured aflagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.HAMLETThis?First ClownE'en that.HAMLETLet me see.Takes the skullAlas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellowof infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hathborne me on his back a thousand times; and now, howabhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims atit. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I knownot how oft. Where be your gibes now? yourgambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not onenow, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, lether paint an inch thick, to this favour she mustcome; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tellme one thing.HORATIOWhat's that, my lord?HAMLETDost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'the earth?HORATIOE'en so.HAMLETAnd smelt so? pah!Puts down the skullHORATIOE'en so, my lord.HAMLETTo what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why maynot imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,till he find it stopping a bung-hole?HORATIO'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.HAMLETNo, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither withmodesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: asthus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; ofearth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto hewas converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.Enter Priest, & c. in procession; the Corpse of OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, & cThe queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?And with such maimed rites?

I tell thee, churlish priest,A ministering angel shall my sister be,When thou liest howling.HAMLETWhat, the fair Ophelia!QUEEN GERTRUDESweets to the sweet: farewell!Scattering flowersI hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,And not have strew'd thy grave.LAERTESO, treble woeFall ten times treble on that cursed head,Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious senseDeprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:Leaps into the graveNow pile your dust upon the quick and dead,Till of this flat a mountain you have made,To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish headOf blue Olympus.HAMLET[Advancing] What is he whose griefBears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrowConjures the wandering stars, and makes them standLike wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,Hamlet the Dane.Leaps into the graveLAERTESThe devil take thy soul!Grappling with himHAMLETThou pray'st not well.I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;For, though I am not splenitive and rash,Yet have I something in me dangerous,Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.KING CLAUDIUSPluck them asunder.QUEEN GERTRUDEHamlet, Hamlet!AllGentlemen,--HORATIOGood my lord, be quiet.The Attendants part them, and they come out of the graveHAMLETWhy I will fight with him upon this themeUntil my eyelids will no longer wag.QUEEN GERTRUDEO my son, what theme?HAMLETI loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothersCould not, with all their quantity of love,Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?KING CLAUDIUSO, he is mad, Laertes.QUEEN GERTRUDEFor love of God, forbear him.HAMLET'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?To outface me with leaping in her grave?Be buried quick with her, and so will I:And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throwMillions of acres on us, till our ground,Singeing his pate against the burning zone,Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,I'll rant as well as thou.QUEEN GERTRUDEThis is mere madness:And thus awhile the fit will work on him;Anon, as patient as the female dove,When that her golden couplets are disclosed,His silence will sit drooping.HAMLETHear you, sir;What is the reason that you use me thus?I loved you ever: but it is no matter;Let Hercules himself do what he may,The cat will mew and dog will have his day.ExitKING CLAUDIUSI pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.Exit HORATIOTo LAERTESStrengthen your patience in our last night's speech;We'll put the matter to the present push.Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.This grave shall have a living monument:An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;Till then, in patience our proceeding be.ExeuntSCENE II. A hall in the castle.Enter HAMLET and HORATIOHAMLETSo much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;You do remember all the circumstance?HORATIORemember it, my lord?HAMLETSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,That would not let me sleep: methought I layWorse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,And praised be rashness for it, let us know,Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach usThere's a divinity that shapes our ends,Rough-hew them how we will,--HORATIOThat is most certain.HAMLETUp from my cabin,My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the darkGroped I to find out them; had my desire.Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrewTo mine own room again; making so bold,My fears forgetting manners, to unsealTheir grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--O royal knavery!--an exact command,Larded with many several sorts of reasonsImporting Denmark's health and England's too,With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,My head should be struck off.HORATIOIs't possible?HAMLETHere's the commission: read it at more leisure.But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?HORATIOI beseech you.HAMLETBeing thus be-netted round with villanies,--Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,They had begun the play--I sat me down,Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:I once did hold it, as our statists do,A baseness to write fair and labour'd muchHow to forget that learning, but, sir, nowIt did me yeoman's service: wilt thou knowThe effect of what I wrote?HORATIOAy, good my lord.HAMLETAn earnest conjuration from the king,As England was his faithful tributary,As love between them like the palm might flourish,As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wearAnd stand a comma 'tween their amities,And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,That, on the view and knowing of these contents,Without debatement further, more or less,He should the bearers put to sudden death,Not shriving-time allow'd.HORATIOHow was this seal'd?HAMLETWhy, even in that was heaven ordinant.I had my father's signet in my purse,Which was the model of that Danish seal;Folded the writ up in form of the other,Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,The changeling never known. Now, the next dayWas our sea-fight; and what to this was sequentThou know'st already.HORATIOSo Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.HAMLETWhy, man, they did make love to this employment;They are not near my conscience; their defeatDoes by their own insinuation grow:'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comesBetween the pass and fell incensed pointsOf mighty opposites.HORATIOWhy, what a king is this!HAMLETDoes it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,Thrown out his angle for my proper life,And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,To let this canker of our nature comeIn further evil?HORATIOIt must be shortly known to him from EnglandWhat is the issue of the business there.HAMLETIt will be short: the interim is mine;And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'But I am very sorry, good Horatio,That to Laertes I forgot myself;For, by the image of my cause, I seeThe portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put meInto a towering passion.HORATIOPeace! who comes here?Enter OSRICOSRICYour lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.HAMLETI humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?HORATIONo, my good lord.HAMLETThy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice toknow him. He hath much land, and fertile: let abeast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand atthe king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,spacious in the possession of dirt.OSRICSweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, Ishould impart a thing to you from his majesty.HAMLETI will receive it, sir, with all diligence ofspirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.OSRICI thank your lordship, it is very hot.HAMLETNo, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind isnortherly.OSRICIt is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.HAMLETBut yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for mycomplexion.OSRICExceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, hismajesty bade me signify to you that he has laid agreat wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--HAMLETI beseech you, remember--HAMLET moves him to put on his hatOSRICNay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believeme, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellentdifferences, of very soft society and great showing:indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card orcalendar of gentry, for you shall find in him thecontinent of what part a gentleman would see.HAMLETSir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;though, I know, to divide him inventorially woulddizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yawneither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in theverity of extolment, I take him to be a soul ofgreat article; and his infusion of such dearth andrareness, as, to make true diction of him, hissemblable is his mirror; and who else would tracehim, his umbrage, nothing more.OSRICYour lordship speaks most infallibly of him.HAMLETThe concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentlemanin our more rawer breath?OSRICSir?HORATIOIs't not possible to understand in another tongue?You will do't, sir, really.HAMLETWhat imports the nomination of this gentleman?OSRICOf Laertes?HORATIOHis purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.HAMLETOf him, sir.OSRICI know you are not ignorant--HAMLETI would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,it would not much approve me. Well, sir?OSRICYou are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--HAMLETI dare not confess that, lest I should compare withhim in excellence; but, to know a man well, were toknow himself.OSRICI mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputationlaid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.HAMLETWhat's his weapon?OSRICRapier and dagger.HAMLETThat's two of his weapons: but, well.OSRICThe king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbaryhorses: against the which he has imponed, as I takeit, six French rapiers and poniards, with theirassigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of thecarriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, veryresponsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,and of very liberal conceit.HAMLETWhat call you the carriages?HORATIOI knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.OSRICThe carriages, sir, are the hangers.HAMLETThe phrase would be more german to the matter, if wecould carry cannon by our sides: I would it mightbe hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horsesagainst six French swords, their assigns, and threeliberal-conceited carriages; that's the French betagainst the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?OSRICThe king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passesbetween yourself and him, he shall not exceed youthree hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and itwould come to immediate trial, if your lordshipwould vouchsafe the answer.HAMLETHow if I answer 'no'?OSRICI mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.HAMLETSir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please hismajesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; letthe foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and theking hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.OSRICShall I re-deliver you e'en so?HAMLETTo this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.OSRICI commend my duty to your lordship.HAMLETYours, yours.Exit OSRICHe does well to commend it himself; there are notongues else for's turn.HORATIOThis lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.HAMLETHe did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that Iknow the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune ofthe time and outward habit of encounter; a kind ofyesty collection, which carries them through andthrough the most fond and winnowed opinions; and dobut blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.Enter a LordLordMy lord, his majesty commended him to you by youngOsric, who brings back to him that you attend him inthe hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold toplay with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.HAMLETI am constant to my purpose; they follow the king'spleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; nowor whensoever, provided I be so able as now.LordThe king and queen and all are coming down.HAMLETIn happy time.LordThe queen desires you to use some gentleentertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.HAMLETShe well instructs me.Exit LordHORATIOYou will lose this wager, my lord.HAMLETI do not think so: since he went into France, Ihave been in continual practise: I shall win at theodds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's hereabout my heart: but it is no matter.HORATIONay, good my lord,--HAMLETIt is but foolery; but it is such a kind ofgain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.HORATIOIf your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I willforestall their repair hither, and say you are notfit.HAMLETNot a whit, we defy augury: there's a specialprovidence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will benow; if it be not now, yet it will come: thereadiness is all: since no man has aught of what heleaves, what is't to leave betimes?Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, & cKING CLAUDIUSCome, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET'sHAMLETGive me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.This presence knows,And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'dWith sore distraction. What I have done,That might your nature, honour and exceptionRoughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.Sir, in this audience,Let my disclaiming from a purposed evilFree me so far in your most generous thoughts,That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,And hurt my brother.LAERTESI am satisfied in nature,Whose motive, in this case, should stir me mostTo my revenge: but in my terms of honourI stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,Till by some elder masters, of known honour,I have a voice and precedent of peace,To keep my name ungored. But till that time,I do receive your offer'd love like love,And will not wrong it.HAMLETI embrace it freely;And will this brother's wager frankly play.Give us the foils. Come on.LAERTESCome, one for me.HAMLETI'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignoranceYour skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,Stick fiery off indeed.LAERTESYou mock me, sir.HAMLETNo, by this hand.KING CLAUDIUSGive them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,You know the wager?HAMLETVery well, my lordYour grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.KING CLAUDIUSI do not fear it; I have seen you both:But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.LAERTESThis is too heavy, let me see another.HAMLETThis likes me well. These foils have all a length?They prepare to playOSRICAy, my good lord.KING CLAUDIUSSet me the stoops of wine upon that table.If Hamlet give the first or second hit,Or quit in answer of the third exchange,Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;And in the cup an union shall he throw,Richer than that which four successive kingsIn Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,The trumpet to the cannoneer without,The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.HAMLETCome on, sir.LAERTESCome, my lord.They playHAMLETOne.LAERTESNo.HAMLETJudgment.OSRICA hit, a very palpable hit.LAERTESWell; again.KING CLAUDIUSStay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;Here's to thy health.Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off withinGive him the cup.HAMLETI'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.They playAnother hit; what say you?LAERTESA touch, a touch, I do confess.KING CLAUDIUSOur son shall win.QUEEN GERTRUDEHe's fat, and scant of breath.Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.HAMLETGood madam!KING CLAUDIUSGertrude, do not drink.QUEEN GERTRUDEI will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.KING CLAUDIUS[Aside] It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.HAMLETI dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.QUEEN GERTRUDECome, let me wipe thy face.LAERTESMy lord, I'll hit him now.KING CLAUDIUSI do not think't.LAERTES[Aside] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.HAMLETCome, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;I pray you, pass with your best violence;I am afeard you make a wanton of me.LAERTESSay you so? come on.They playOSRICNothing, neither way.LAERTESHave at you now!LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTESKING CLAUDIUSPart them; they are incensed.HAMLETNay, come, again.QUEEN GERTRUDE fallsOSRICLook to the queen there, ho!HORATIOThey bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?OSRICHow is't, Laertes?LAERTESWhy, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.HAMLETHow does the queen?KING CLAUDIUSShe swounds to see them bleed.QUEEN GERTRUDENo, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.DiesHAMLETO villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:Treachery! Seek it out.LAERTESIt is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;No medicine in the world can do thee good;In thee there is not half an hour of life;The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practiseHath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.HAMLETThe point!--envenom'd too!Then, venom, to thy work.Stabs KING CLAUDIUSAllTreason! treason!KING CLAUDIUSO, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.HAMLETHere, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?Follow my mother.KING CLAUDIUS diesLAERTESHe is justly served;It is a poison temper'd by himself.Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,Nor thine on me.DiesHAMLETHeaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!You that look pale and tremble at this chance,That are but mutes or audience to this act,Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;Thou livest; report me and my cause arightTo the unsatisfied.HORATIONever believe it:I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:Here's yet some liquor left.HAMLETAs thou'rt a man,Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.O good Horatio, what a wounded name,Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!If thou didst ever hold me in thy heartAbsent thee from felicity awhile,And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,To tell my story.March afar off, and shot withinWhat warlike noise is this?OSRICYoung Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,To the ambassadors of England givesThis warlike volley.HAMLETO, I die, Horatio;The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:I cannot live to hear the news from England;But I do prophesy the election lightsOn Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,Which have solicited. The rest is silence.DiesHORATIONow cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!Why does the drum come hither?March withinEnter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and othersPRINCE FORTINBRASWhere is this sight?HORATIOWhat is it ye would see?If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.PRINCE FORTINBRASThis quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,That thou so many princes at a shotSo bloodily hast struck?First AmbassadorThe sight is dismal;And our affairs from England come too late:The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:Where should we have our thanks?HORATIONot from his mouth,Had it the ability of life to thank you:He never gave commandment for their death.But since, so jump upon this bloody question,You from the Polack wars, and you from England,Are here arrived give order that these bodiesHigh on a stage be placed to the view;And let me speak to the yet unknowing worldHow these things came about: so shall you hearOf carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,And, in this upshot, purposes mistookFall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can ITruly deliver.PRINCE FORTINBRASLet us haste to hear it,And call the noblest to the audience.For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.HORATIOOf that I shall have also cause to speak,And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;But let this same be presently perform'd,Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischanceOn plots and errors, happen.PRINCE FORTINBRASLet four captainsBear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;For he was likely, had he been put on,To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,The soldiers' music and the rites of warSpeak loudly for him.Take up the bodies: such a sight as thisBecomes the field, but here shows much amiss.Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
