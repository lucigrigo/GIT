The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 13700712 nanoseconds (0.013700712 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 1555531 nanoseconds (0.001555531 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 12145181 nanoseconds (0.012145181 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 6851537 nanoseconds (0.006851537 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 5293644 nanoseconds (0.005293644 seconds).
