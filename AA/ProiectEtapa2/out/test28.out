The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 12870637 nanoseconds (0.012870637 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -438561 nanoseconds (-4.38561E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 13309198 nanoseconds (0.013309198 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 6137776 nanoseconds (0.006137776 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 7171422 nanoseconds (0.007171422 seconds).
