The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 966109 nanoseconds (9.66109E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 64032 nanoseconds (6.4032E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 902077 nanoseconds (9.02077E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 218541 nanoseconds (2.18541E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 683536 nanoseconds (6.83536E-4 seconds).
