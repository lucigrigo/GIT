The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 443786 nanoseconds (4.43786E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 277890 nanoseconds (2.7789E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 721676 nanoseconds (7.21676E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 15
	match 3 at index 1676
	match 4 at index 2567
	match 5 at index 4033
	match 6 at index 7400

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 163283 nanoseconds (1.63283E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 15
	match 3 at index 1676
