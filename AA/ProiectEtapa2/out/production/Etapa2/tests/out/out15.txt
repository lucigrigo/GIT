The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 626511 nanoseconds (6.26511E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -153282 nanoseconds (-1.53282E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 779793 nanoseconds (7.79793E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 15
	match 3 at index 1676
	match 4 at index 2567
	match 5 at index 4033
	match 6 at index 7400

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 156683 nanoseconds (1.56683E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 15
	match 3 at index 1676
