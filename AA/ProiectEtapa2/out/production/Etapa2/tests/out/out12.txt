The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 344494 nanoseconds (3.44494E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 23370 nanoseconds (2.337E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 367864 nanoseconds (3.67864E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (10) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 18
	match 2 at index 146
	match 3 at index 226
	match 4 at index 353
