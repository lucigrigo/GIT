The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 27538 nanoseconds (2.7538E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -41620 nanoseconds (-4.162E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 69158 nanoseconds (6.9158E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (8) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 13
	match 2 at index 30
	match 3 at index 38
	match 4 at index 47
	match 5 at index 68
	match 6 at index 87
	match 7 at index 100
	match 8 at index 115

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 22986 nanoseconds (2.2986E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (8) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 13
	match 2 at index 30
	match 3 at index 38
	match 4 at index 47
	match 5 at index 68
	match 6 at index 87
	match 7 at index 100
	match 8 at index 115


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 46172 nanoseconds (4.6172E-5 seconds).
