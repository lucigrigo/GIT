The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 10256890 nanoseconds (0.01025689 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -1199572 nanoseconds (-0.001199572 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 11456462 nanoseconds (0.011456462 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 5713223 nanoseconds (0.005713223 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 5743239 nanoseconds (0.005743239 seconds).
