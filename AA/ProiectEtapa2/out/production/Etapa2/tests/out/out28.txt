The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 9957065 nanoseconds (0.009957065 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 1780524 nanoseconds (0.001780524 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 11737589 nanoseconds (0.011737589 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 5912305 nanoseconds (0.005912305 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 5825284 nanoseconds (0.005825284 seconds).
