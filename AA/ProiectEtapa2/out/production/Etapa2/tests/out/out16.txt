The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 678026 nanoseconds (6.78026E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 27202 nanoseconds (2.7202E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 650824 nanoseconds (6.50824E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 151958 nanoseconds (1.51958E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 498866 nanoseconds (4.98866E-4 seconds).
