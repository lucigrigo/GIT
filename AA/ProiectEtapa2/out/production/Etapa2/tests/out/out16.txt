The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 451264 nanoseconds (4.51264E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 362133 nanoseconds (3.62133E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 813397 nanoseconds (8.13397E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 149510 nanoseconds (1.4951E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 663887 nanoseconds (6.63887E-4 seconds).
