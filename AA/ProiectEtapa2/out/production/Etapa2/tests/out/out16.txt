The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 701644 nanoseconds (7.01644E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -83220 nanoseconds (-8.322E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 618424 nanoseconds (6.18424E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 156222 nanoseconds (1.56222E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 462202 nanoseconds (4.62202E-4 seconds).
