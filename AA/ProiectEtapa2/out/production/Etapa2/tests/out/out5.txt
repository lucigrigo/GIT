The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 34375 nanoseconds (3.4375E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 35445 nanoseconds (3.5445E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 69820 nanoseconds (6.982E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 16643 nanoseconds (1.6643E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 53177 nanoseconds (5.3177E-5 seconds).
