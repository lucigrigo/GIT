The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 86837 nanoseconds (8.6837E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -24346 nanoseconds (-2.4346E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 62491 nanoseconds (6.2491E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 15655 nanoseconds (1.5655E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 46836 nanoseconds (4.6836E-5 seconds).
