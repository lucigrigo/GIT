The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 82104 nanoseconds (8.2104E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 710 nanoseconds (7.1E-7 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 81394 nanoseconds (8.1394E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 16773 nanoseconds (1.6773E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 64621 nanoseconds (6.4621E-5 seconds).
