The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 76041 nanoseconds (7.6041E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 35729 nanoseconds (3.5729E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 111770 nanoseconds (1.1177E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 29101 nanoseconds (2.9101E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 82669 nanoseconds (8.2669E-5 seconds).
