The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 139268 nanoseconds (1.39268E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -33394 nanoseconds (-3.3394E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 105874 nanoseconds (1.05874E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 21800 nanoseconds (2.18E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 84074 nanoseconds (8.4074E-5 seconds).
