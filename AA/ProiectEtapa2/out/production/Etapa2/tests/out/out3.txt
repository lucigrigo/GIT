The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 135983 nanoseconds (1.35983E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 3713 nanoseconds (3.713E-6 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 132270 nanoseconds (1.3227E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 26806 nanoseconds (2.6806E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 105464 nanoseconds (1.05464E-4 seconds).
