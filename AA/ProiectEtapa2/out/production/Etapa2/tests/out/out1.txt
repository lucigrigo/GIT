The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 8259 nanoseconds (8.259E-6 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -53658 nanoseconds (-5.3658E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 61917 nanoseconds (6.1917E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 8

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 22384 nanoseconds (2.2384E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 8


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 39533 nanoseconds (3.9533E-5 seconds).
