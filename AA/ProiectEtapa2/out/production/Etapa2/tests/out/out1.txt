The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 8749 nanoseconds (8.749E-6 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 52998 nanoseconds (5.2998E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 61747 nanoseconds (6.1747E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 8

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 21000 nanoseconds (2.1E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 8


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 40747 nanoseconds (4.0747E-5 seconds).
