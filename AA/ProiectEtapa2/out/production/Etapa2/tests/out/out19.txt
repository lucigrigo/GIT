The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 732505 nanoseconds (7.32505E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 65994 nanoseconds (6.5994E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 798499 nanoseconds (7.98499E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 150872 nanoseconds (1.50872E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 647627 nanoseconds (6.47627E-4 seconds).
