The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 745878 nanoseconds (7.45878E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -43830 nanoseconds (-4.383E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 789708 nanoseconds (7.89708E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 153605 nanoseconds (1.53605E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 636103 nanoseconds (6.36103E-4 seconds).
