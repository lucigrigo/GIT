The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 8907585 nanoseconds (0.008907585 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 2138375 nanoseconds (0.002138375 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 11045960 nanoseconds (0.01104596 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 6168258 nanoseconds (0.006168258 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 4877702 nanoseconds (0.004877702 seconds).
