The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 8778345 nanoseconds (0.008778345 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -2115123 nanoseconds (-0.002115123 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 10893468 nanoseconds (0.010893468 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 6389281 nanoseconds (0.006389281 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 4504187 nanoseconds (0.004504187 seconds).
