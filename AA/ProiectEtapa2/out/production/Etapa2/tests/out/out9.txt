The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 85043 nanoseconds (8.5043E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 6978 nanoseconds (6.978E-6 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 92021 nanoseconds (9.2021E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
