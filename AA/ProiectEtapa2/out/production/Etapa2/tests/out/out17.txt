The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 593609 nanoseconds (5.93609E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 156772 nanoseconds (1.56772E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 750381 nanoseconds (7.50381E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 207017 nanoseconds (2.07017E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 543364 nanoseconds (5.43364E-4 seconds).
