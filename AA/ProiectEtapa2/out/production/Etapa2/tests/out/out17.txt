The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 474133 nanoseconds (4.74133E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 217197 nanoseconds (2.17197E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 691330 nanoseconds (6.9133E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 182340 nanoseconds (1.8234E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 508990 nanoseconds (5.0899E-4 seconds).
