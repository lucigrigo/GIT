The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 572295 nanoseconds (5.72295E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -91218 nanoseconds (-9.1218E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 663513 nanoseconds (6.63513E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 185494 nanoseconds (1.85494E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 478019 nanoseconds (4.78019E-4 seconds).
