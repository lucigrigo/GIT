The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 16161 nanoseconds (1.6161E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 43671 nanoseconds (4.3671E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 59832 nanoseconds (5.9832E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 22

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 19822 nanoseconds (1.9822E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 22


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 40010 nanoseconds (4.001E-5 seconds).
