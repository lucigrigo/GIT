The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 14415 nanoseconds (1.4415E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -55143 nanoseconds (-5.5143E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 69558 nanoseconds (6.9558E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 22

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 22546 nanoseconds (2.2546E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 22


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 47012 nanoseconds (4.7012E-5 seconds).
