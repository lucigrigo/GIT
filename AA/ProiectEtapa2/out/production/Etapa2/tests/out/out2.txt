The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 13267 nanoseconds (1.3267E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 53972 nanoseconds (5.3972E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 67239 nanoseconds (6.7239E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 22

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 21690 nanoseconds (2.169E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 22


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 45549 nanoseconds (4.5549E-5 seconds).
