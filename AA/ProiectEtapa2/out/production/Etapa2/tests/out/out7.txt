The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 57860 nanoseconds (5.786E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 47988 nanoseconds (4.7988E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 105848 nanoseconds (1.05848E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 127
	match 3 at index 155

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 25062 nanoseconds (2.5062E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 127
	match 3 at index 155


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 80786 nanoseconds (8.0786E-5 seconds).
