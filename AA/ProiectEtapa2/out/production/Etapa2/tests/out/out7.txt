The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 138951 nanoseconds (1.38951E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -36544 nanoseconds (-3.6544E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 102407 nanoseconds (1.02407E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 127
	match 3 at index 155

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 24267 nanoseconds (2.4267E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 127
	match 3 at index 155


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 78140 nanoseconds (7.814E-5 seconds).
