The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 156355 nanoseconds (1.56355E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 42949 nanoseconds (4.2949E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 113406 nanoseconds (1.13406E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 127
	match 3 at index 155

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 24203 nanoseconds (2.4203E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 127
	match 3 at index 155


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 89203 nanoseconds (8.9203E-5 seconds).
