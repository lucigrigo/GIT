The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 650925 nanoseconds (6.50925E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -91368 nanoseconds (-9.1368E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 742293 nanoseconds (7.42293E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 146100 nanoseconds (1.461E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 596193 nanoseconds (5.96193E-4 seconds).
