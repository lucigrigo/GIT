The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 691920 nanoseconds (6.9192E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 86941 nanoseconds (8.6941E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 778861 nanoseconds (7.78861E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 142388 nanoseconds (1.42388E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 636473 nanoseconds (6.36473E-4 seconds).
