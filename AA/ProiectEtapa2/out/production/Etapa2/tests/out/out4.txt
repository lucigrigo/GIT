The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 28900 nanoseconds (2.89E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 72843 nanoseconds (7.2843E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 101743 nanoseconds (1.01743E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 21152 nanoseconds (2.1152E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 80591 nanoseconds (8.0591E-5 seconds).
