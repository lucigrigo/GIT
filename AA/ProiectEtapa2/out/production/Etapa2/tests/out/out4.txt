The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 58870 nanoseconds (5.887E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -13260 nanoseconds (-1.326E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 72130 nanoseconds (7.213E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 20052 nanoseconds (2.0052E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 52078 nanoseconds (5.2078E-5 seconds).
