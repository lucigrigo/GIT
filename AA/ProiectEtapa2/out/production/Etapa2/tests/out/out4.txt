The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 66816 nanoseconds (6.6816E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 8910 nanoseconds (8.91E-6 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 75726 nanoseconds (7.5726E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 21719 nanoseconds (2.1719E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 54007 nanoseconds (5.4007E-5 seconds).
