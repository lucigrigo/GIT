The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 121870 nanoseconds (1.2187E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -19836 nanoseconds (-1.9836E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 102034 nanoseconds (1.02034E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 11
	match 2 at index 45
	match 3 at index 79
	match 4 at index 113
	match 5 at index 144
	match 6 at index 178

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 27290 nanoseconds (2.729E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 11
	match 2 at index 45
	match 3 at index 79
	match 4 at index 113
	match 5 at index 144
	match 6 at index 178


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 74744 nanoseconds (7.4744E-5 seconds).
