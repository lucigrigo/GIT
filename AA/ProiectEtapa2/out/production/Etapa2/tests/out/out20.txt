The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 1068270 nanoseconds (0.00106827 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 163177 nanoseconds (1.63177E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 905093 nanoseconds (9.05093E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 195842 nanoseconds (1.95842E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 709251 nanoseconds (7.09251E-4 seconds).
