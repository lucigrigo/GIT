The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 470594 nanoseconds (4.70594E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 401489 nanoseconds (4.01489E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 872083 nanoseconds (8.72083E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 184953 nanoseconds (1.84953E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 687130 nanoseconds (6.8713E-4 seconds).
