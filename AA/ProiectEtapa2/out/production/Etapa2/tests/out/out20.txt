The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 1204943 nanoseconds (0.001204943 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -193243 nanoseconds (-1.93243E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 1011700 nanoseconds (0.0010117 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 192917 nanoseconds (1.92917E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 818783 nanoseconds (8.18783E-4 seconds).
