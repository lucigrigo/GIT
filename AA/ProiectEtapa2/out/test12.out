The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 304405 nanoseconds (3.04405E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -49022 nanoseconds (-4.9022E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 353427 nanoseconds (3.53427E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (10) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 18
	match 2 at index 146
	match 3 at index 226
	match 4 at index 353
	match 5 at index 618
	match 6 at index 1146
	match 7 at index 2057

	match 9 at index 3151
	match 10 at index 3175

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 88559 nanoseconds (8.8559E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (10) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 18
	match 2 at index 146
	match 3 at index 226
