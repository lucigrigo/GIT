The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 8529 nanoseconds (8.529E-6 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -53237 nanoseconds (-5.3237E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 61766 nanoseconds (6.1766E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 8

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 23422 nanoseconds (2.3422E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 8


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 38344 nanoseconds (3.8344E-5 seconds).
