Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 730320 nanoseconds (7.3032E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 421092 nanoseconds (4.21092E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 309228 nanoseconds (3.09228E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 139017 nanoseconds (1.39017E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 591303 nanoseconds (5.91303E-4 seconds).
