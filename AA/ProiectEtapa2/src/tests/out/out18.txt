The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 624095 nanoseconds (6.24095E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -74770 nanoseconds (-7.477E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 698865 nanoseconds (6.98865E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 162578 nanoseconds (1.62578E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 536287 nanoseconds (5.36287E-4 seconds).
