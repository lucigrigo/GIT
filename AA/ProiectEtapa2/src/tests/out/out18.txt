The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 633910 nanoseconds (6.3391E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -104245 nanoseconds (-1.04245E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 738155 nanoseconds (7.38155E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 160409 nanoseconds (1.60409E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 577746 nanoseconds (5.77746E-4 seconds).
