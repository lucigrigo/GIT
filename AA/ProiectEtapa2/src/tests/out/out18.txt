The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 374702 nanoseconds (3.74702E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 351872 nanoseconds (3.51872E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 726574 nanoseconds (7.26574E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 142683 nanoseconds (1.42683E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 583891 nanoseconds (5.83891E-4 seconds).
