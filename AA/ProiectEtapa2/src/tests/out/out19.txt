Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 801949 nanoseconds (8.01949E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 487116 nanoseconds (4.87116E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 314833 nanoseconds (3.14833E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 138575 nanoseconds (1.38575E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 663374 nanoseconds (6.63374E-4 seconds).
