The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 370924 nanoseconds (3.70924E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 424615 nanoseconds (4.24615E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 795539 nanoseconds (7.95539E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 168874 nanoseconds (1.68874E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 626665 nanoseconds (6.26665E-4 seconds).
