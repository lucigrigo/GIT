The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 728909 nanoseconds (7.28909E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -84272 nanoseconds (-8.4272E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 813181 nanoseconds (8.13181E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 163962 nanoseconds (1.63962E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 649219 nanoseconds (6.49219E-4 seconds).
