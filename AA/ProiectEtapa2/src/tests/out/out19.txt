The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 710521 nanoseconds (7.10521E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -34530 nanoseconds (-3.453E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 745051 nanoseconds (7.45051E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 163591 nanoseconds (1.63591E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 581460 nanoseconds (5.8146E-4 seconds).
