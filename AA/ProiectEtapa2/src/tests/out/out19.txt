The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 877596 nanoseconds (8.77596E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 74222 nanoseconds (7.4222E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 803374 nanoseconds (8.03374E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 190769 nanoseconds (1.90769E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 612605 nanoseconds (6.12605E-4 seconds).
