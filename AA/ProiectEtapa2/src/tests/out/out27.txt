The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 9171902 nanoseconds (0.009171902 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -1669536 nanoseconds (-0.001669536 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 10841438 nanoseconds (0.010841438 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 6266105 nanoseconds (0.006266105 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 4575333 nanoseconds (0.004575333 seconds).
