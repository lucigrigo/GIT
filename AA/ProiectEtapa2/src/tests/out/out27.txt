The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 9033330 nanoseconds (0.00903333 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -1816545 nanoseconds (-0.001816545 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 10849875 nanoseconds (0.010849875 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 6236874 nanoseconds (0.006236874 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 4613001 nanoseconds (0.004613001 seconds).
