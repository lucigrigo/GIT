The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 9060588 nanoseconds (0.009060588 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -1708543 nanoseconds (-0.001708543 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 10769131 nanoseconds (0.010769131 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 6160967 nanoseconds (0.006160967 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 4608164 nanoseconds (0.004608164 seconds).
