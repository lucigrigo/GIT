The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 6819236 nanoseconds (0.006819236 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 4410371 nanoseconds (0.004410371 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 11229607 nanoseconds (0.011229607 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 6268014 nanoseconds (0.006268014 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 4961593 nanoseconds (0.004961593 seconds).
