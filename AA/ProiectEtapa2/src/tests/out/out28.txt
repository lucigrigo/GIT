The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 10343771 nanoseconds (0.010343771 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -1199468 nanoseconds (-0.001199468 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 11543239 nanoseconds (0.011543239 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 5889878 nanoseconds (0.005889878 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 5653361 nanoseconds (0.005653361 seconds).
