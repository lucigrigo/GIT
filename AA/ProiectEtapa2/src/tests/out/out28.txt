The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 8173616 nanoseconds (0.008173616 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 3793834 nanoseconds (0.003793834 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 11967450 nanoseconds (0.01196745 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 5895855 nanoseconds (0.005895855 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 6071595 nanoseconds (0.006071595 seconds).
