The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 10335713 nanoseconds (0.010335713 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -1204495 nanoseconds (-0.001204495 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 11540208 nanoseconds (0.011540208 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 6017412 nanoseconds (0.006017412 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 5522796 nanoseconds (0.005522796 seconds).
