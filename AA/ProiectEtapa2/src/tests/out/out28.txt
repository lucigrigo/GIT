The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 10277049 nanoseconds (0.010277049 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -2028841 nanoseconds (-0.002028841 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 12305890 nanoseconds (0.01230589 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 5730748 nanoseconds (0.005730748 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 6575142 nanoseconds (0.006575142 seconds).
