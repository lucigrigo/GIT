Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 90174 nanoseconds (9.0174E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 0
	match 2 at 127
	match 3 at 155


The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 62820 nanoseconds (6.282E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 27354 nanoseconds (2.7354E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 26876 nanoseconds (2.6876E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 0
	match 2 at 127
	match 3 at 155


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 63298 nanoseconds (6.3298E-5 seconds).
