The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 129463 nanoseconds (1.29463E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 35233 nanoseconds (3.5233E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 94230 nanoseconds (9.423E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 127
	match 3 at index 155

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 27960 nanoseconds (2.796E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 127
	match 3 at index 155


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 66270 nanoseconds (6.627E-5 seconds).
