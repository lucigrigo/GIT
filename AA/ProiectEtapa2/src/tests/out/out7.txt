Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 146313 nanoseconds (1.46313E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 0
	match 2 at 127
	match 3 at 155

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 23605 nanoseconds (2.3605E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 0
	match 2 at 127
	match 3 at 155


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 122708 nanoseconds (1.22708E-4 seconds).
