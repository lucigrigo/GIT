The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 53795 nanoseconds (5.3795E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 39462 nanoseconds (3.9462E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 93257 nanoseconds (9.3257E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 127
	match 3 at index 155

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 27236 nanoseconds (2.7236E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (3) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 127
	match 3 at index 155


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 66021 nanoseconds (6.6021E-5 seconds).
