The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 100076 nanoseconds (1.00076E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 1780 nanoseconds (1.78E-6 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 98296 nanoseconds (9.8296E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 11
	match 2 at index 45
	match 3 at index 79
	match 4 at index 113
	match 5 at index 144
	match 6 at index 178

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 26905 nanoseconds (2.6905E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 11
	match 2 at index 45
	match 3 at index 79
	match 4 at index 113
	match 5 at index 144
	match 6 at index 178


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 71391 nanoseconds (7.1391E-5 seconds).
