Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 81477 nanoseconds (8.1477E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 11
	match 2 at 45
	match 3 at 79
	match 4 at 113
	match 5 at 144
	match 6 at 178


The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 54579 nanoseconds (5.4579E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 26898 nanoseconds (2.6898E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 22881 nanoseconds (2.2881E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 11
	match 2 at 45
	match 3 at 79
	match 4 at 113
	match 5 at 144
	match 6 at 178


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 58596 nanoseconds (5.8596E-5 seconds).
