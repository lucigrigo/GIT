The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 60321 nanoseconds (6.0321E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -9614 nanoseconds (-9.614E-6 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 69935 nanoseconds (6.9935E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 24542 nanoseconds (2.4542E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 45393 nanoseconds (4.5393E-5 seconds).
