The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 58732 nanoseconds (5.8732E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -9774 nanoseconds (-9.774E-6 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 68506 nanoseconds (6.8506E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 19386 nanoseconds (1.9386E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 49120 nanoseconds (4.912E-5 seconds).
