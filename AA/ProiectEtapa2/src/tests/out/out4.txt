The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 26799 nanoseconds (2.6799E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 38389 nanoseconds (3.8389E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 65188 nanoseconds (6.5188E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 53212 nanoseconds (5.3212E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 11976 nanoseconds (1.1976E-5 seconds).
