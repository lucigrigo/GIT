Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 80652 nanoseconds (8.0652E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 74


The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 29920 nanoseconds (2.992E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 50732 nanoseconds (5.0732E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 24148 nanoseconds (2.4148E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 74


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 56504 nanoseconds (5.6504E-5 seconds).
