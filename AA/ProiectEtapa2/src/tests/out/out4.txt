Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 101922 nanoseconds (1.01922E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 74

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 17814 nanoseconds (1.7814E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 74


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 84108 nanoseconds (8.4108E-5 seconds).
