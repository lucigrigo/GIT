The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 59212 nanoseconds (5.9212E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -91755 nanoseconds (-9.1755E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 150967 nanoseconds (1.50967E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 24841 nanoseconds (2.4841E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 74


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 126126 nanoseconds (1.26126E-4 seconds).
