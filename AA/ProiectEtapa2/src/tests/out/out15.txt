The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 582755 nanoseconds (5.82755E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 6294 nanoseconds (6.294E-6 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 576461 nanoseconds (5.76461E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 15
	match 3 at index 1676
	match 4 at index 2567
	match 5 at index 4033
	match 6 at index 7400

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 164237 nanoseconds (1.64237E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 15
	match 3 at index 1676
	match 4 at index 2567
	match 5 at index 4033
	match 6 at index 7400


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 412224 nanoseconds (4.12224E-4 seconds).
