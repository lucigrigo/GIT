The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 730783 nanoseconds (7.30783E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -164407 nanoseconds (-1.64407E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 895190 nanoseconds (8.9519E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 15
