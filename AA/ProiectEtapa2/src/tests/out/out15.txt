Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 805974 nanoseconds (8.05974E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 0
	match 2 at 15
	match 3 at 1676
	match 4 at 2567
	match 5 at 4033
	match 6 at 7400


The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 653764 nanoseconds (6.53764E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 152210 nanoseconds (1.5221E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 160105 nanoseconds (1.60105E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (6) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 0
	match 2 at 15
	match 3 at 1676
	match 4 at 2567
	match 5 at 4033
	match 6 at 7400


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 645869 nanoseconds (6.45869E-4 seconds).
