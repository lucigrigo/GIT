Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 70827 nanoseconds (7.0827E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (8) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 13
	match 2 at 30
	match 3 at 38
	match 4 at 47
	match 5 at 68
	match 6 at 87
	match 7 at 100
	match 8 at 115


The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 36571 nanoseconds (3.6571E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 34256 nanoseconds (3.4256E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 26539 nanoseconds (2.6539E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (8) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 13
	match 2 at 30
	match 3 at 38
	match 4 at 47
	match 5 at 68
	match 6 at 87
	match 7 at 100
	match 8 at 115


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 44288 nanoseconds (4.4288E-5 seconds).
