Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 112694 nanoseconds (1.12694E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (8) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 13
	match 2 at 30
	match 3 at 38
	match 4 at 47
	match 5 at 68
	match 6 at 87
	match 7 at 100
	match 8 at 115

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 26956 nanoseconds (2.6956E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (8) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 13
	match 2 at 30
	match 3 at 38
	match 4 at 47
	match 5 at 68
	match 6 at 87
	match 7 at 100
	match 8 at 115


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 85738 nanoseconds (8.5738E-5 seconds).
