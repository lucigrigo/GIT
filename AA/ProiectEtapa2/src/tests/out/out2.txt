Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 76728 nanoseconds (7.6728E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 22

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 14153 nanoseconds (1.4153E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 22


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 62575 nanoseconds (6.2575E-5 seconds).
