The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 11934 nanoseconds (1.1934E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -43458 nanoseconds (-4.3458E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 55392 nanoseconds (5.5392E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 22

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 23420 nanoseconds (2.342E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 22


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 31972 nanoseconds (3.1972E-5 seconds).
