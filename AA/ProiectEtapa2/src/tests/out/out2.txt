Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 58214 nanoseconds (5.8214E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 22


The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 19819 nanoseconds (1.9819E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 38395 nanoseconds (3.8395E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 22493 nanoseconds (2.2493E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 22


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 35721 nanoseconds (3.5721E-5 seconds).
