The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 11950 nanoseconds (1.195E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -45093 nanoseconds (-4.5093E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 57043 nanoseconds (5.7043E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 22

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 86706 nanoseconds (8.6706E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 22


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Rabin-Karp was faster than Knuth-Morris-Pratt by 29663 nanoseconds (2.9663E-5 seconds).
