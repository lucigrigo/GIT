The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 15028 nanoseconds (1.5028E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 39967 nanoseconds (3.9967E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 54995 nanoseconds (5.4995E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 22

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 39272 nanoseconds (3.9272E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 22


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 15723 nanoseconds (1.5723E-5 seconds).
