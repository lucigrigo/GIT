Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 151718 nanoseconds (1.51718E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 128

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 22143 nanoseconds (2.2143E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 128


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 129575 nanoseconds (1.29575E-4 seconds).
