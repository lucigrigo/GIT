The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 155872 nanoseconds (1.55872E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 71585 nanoseconds (7.1585E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 84287 nanoseconds (8.4287E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 26508 nanoseconds (2.6508E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 57779 nanoseconds (5.7779E-5 seconds).
