The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 61122 nanoseconds (6.1122E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 24036 nanoseconds (2.4036E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 85158 nanoseconds (8.5158E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 26405 nanoseconds (2.6405E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 58753 nanoseconds (5.8753E-5 seconds).
