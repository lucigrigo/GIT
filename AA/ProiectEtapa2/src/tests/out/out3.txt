The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 129268 nanoseconds (1.29268E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 41770 nanoseconds (4.177E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 87498 nanoseconds (8.7498E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 23706 nanoseconds (2.3706E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 63792 nanoseconds (6.3792E-5 seconds).
