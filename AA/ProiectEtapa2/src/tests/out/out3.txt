The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 112699 nanoseconds (1.12699E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 19916 nanoseconds (1.9916E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 92783 nanoseconds (9.2783E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 29378 nanoseconds (2.9378E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 128


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 63405 nanoseconds (6.3405E-5 seconds).
