Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 85637 nanoseconds (8.5637E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 128


The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 59412 nanoseconds (5.9412E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 26225 nanoseconds (2.6225E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 25902 nanoseconds (2.5902E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 128


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 59735 nanoseconds (5.9735E-5 seconds).
