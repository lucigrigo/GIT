The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 598215 nanoseconds (5.98215E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -169100 nanoseconds (-1.691E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 767315 nanoseconds (7.67315E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 203027 nanoseconds (2.03027E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 564288 nanoseconds (5.64288E-4 seconds).
