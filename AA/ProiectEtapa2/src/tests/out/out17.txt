Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 624175 nanoseconds (6.24175E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 637618 nanoseconds (6.37618E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -13443 nanoseconds (-1.3443E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 187034 nanoseconds (1.87034E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 437141 nanoseconds (4.37141E-4 seconds).
