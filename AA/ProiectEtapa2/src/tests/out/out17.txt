The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 810343 nanoseconds (8.10343E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 190606 nanoseconds (1.90606E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 619737 nanoseconds (6.19737E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 191617 nanoseconds (1.91617E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 428120 nanoseconds (4.2812E-4 seconds).
