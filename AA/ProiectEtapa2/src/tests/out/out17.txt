The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 472916 nanoseconds (4.72916E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 49785 nanoseconds (4.9785E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 522701 nanoseconds (5.22701E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 193259 nanoseconds (1.93259E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 329442 nanoseconds (3.29442E-4 seconds).
