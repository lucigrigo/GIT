The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 592865 nanoseconds (5.92865E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -69662 nanoseconds (-6.9662E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 662527 nanoseconds (6.62527E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 236408 nanoseconds (2.36408E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 426119 nanoseconds (4.26119E-4 seconds).
