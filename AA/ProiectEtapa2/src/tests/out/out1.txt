The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 9557 nanoseconds (9.557E-6 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 45024 nanoseconds (4.5024E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 54581 nanoseconds (5.4581E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 8

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 23615 nanoseconds (2.3615E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 8


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 30966 nanoseconds (3.0966E-5 seconds).
