The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 7277 nanoseconds (7.277E-6 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -44810 nanoseconds (-4.481E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 52087 nanoseconds (5.2087E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 8

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 22803 nanoseconds (2.2803E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 8


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 29284 nanoseconds (2.9284E-5 seconds).
