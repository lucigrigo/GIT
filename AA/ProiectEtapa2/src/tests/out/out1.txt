The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 7569 nanoseconds (7.569E-6 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -44495 nanoseconds (-4.4495E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 52064 nanoseconds (5.2064E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 8

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 22950 nanoseconds (2.295E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 8


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 29114 nanoseconds (2.9114E-5 seconds).
