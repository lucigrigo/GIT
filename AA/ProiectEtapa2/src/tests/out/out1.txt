Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 53756 nanoseconds (5.3756E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 8


The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 14790 nanoseconds (1.479E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 38966 nanoseconds (3.8966E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 23481 nanoseconds (2.3481E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 8


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 30275 nanoseconds (3.0275E-5 seconds).
