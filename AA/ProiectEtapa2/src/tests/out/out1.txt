The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 7954 nanoseconds (7.954E-6 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -48418 nanoseconds (-4.8418E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 56372 nanoseconds (5.6372E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 8

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 24375 nanoseconds (2.4375E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 8


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 31997 nanoseconds (3.1997E-5 seconds).
