Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 74096 nanoseconds (7.4096E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 8

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 18227 nanoseconds (1.8227E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (1) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 8


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 55869 nanoseconds (5.5869E-5 seconds).
