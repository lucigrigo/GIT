The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 708571 nanoseconds (7.08571E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -38223 nanoseconds (-3.8223E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 746794 nanoseconds (7.46794E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 157505 nanoseconds (1.57505E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 589289 nanoseconds (5.89289E-4 seconds).
