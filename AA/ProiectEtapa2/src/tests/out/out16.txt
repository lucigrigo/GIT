The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 896334 nanoseconds (8.96334E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 156193 nanoseconds (1.56193E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 740141 nanoseconds (7.40141E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 155693 nanoseconds (1.55693E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 584448 nanoseconds (5.84448E-4 seconds).
