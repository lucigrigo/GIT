Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 728694 nanoseconds (7.28694E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 459176 nanoseconds (4.59176E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 269518 nanoseconds (2.69518E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 146454 nanoseconds (1.46454E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 582240 nanoseconds (5.8224E-4 seconds).
