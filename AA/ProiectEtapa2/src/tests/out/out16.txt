The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 509579 nanoseconds (5.09579E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 411762 nanoseconds (4.11762E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 921341 nanoseconds (9.21341E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 170272 nanoseconds (1.70272E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 751069 nanoseconds (7.51069E-4 seconds).
