The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 669316 nanoseconds (6.69316E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -144389 nanoseconds (-1.44389E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 813705 nanoseconds (8.13705E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 162090 nanoseconds (1.6209E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 651615 nanoseconds (6.51615E-4 seconds).
