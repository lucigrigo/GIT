The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 33128 nanoseconds (3.3128E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 34143 nanoseconds (3.4143E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 67271 nanoseconds (6.7271E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 28175 nanoseconds (2.8175E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 39096 nanoseconds (3.9096E-5 seconds).
