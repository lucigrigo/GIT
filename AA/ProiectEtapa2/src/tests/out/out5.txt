The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 77712 nanoseconds (7.7712E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 18885 nanoseconds (1.8885E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 58827 nanoseconds (5.8827E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 28935 nanoseconds (2.8935E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 29892 nanoseconds (2.9892E-5 seconds).
