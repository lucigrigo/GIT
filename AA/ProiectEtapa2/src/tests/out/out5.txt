The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 77003 nanoseconds (7.7003E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 19801 nanoseconds (1.9801E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 57202 nanoseconds (5.7202E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 17778 nanoseconds (1.7778E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 39424 nanoseconds (3.9424E-5 seconds).
