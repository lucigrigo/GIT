The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 86605 nanoseconds (8.6605E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 20272 nanoseconds (2.0272E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 66333 nanoseconds (6.6333E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 15644 nanoseconds (1.5644E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 50689 nanoseconds (5.0689E-5 seconds).
