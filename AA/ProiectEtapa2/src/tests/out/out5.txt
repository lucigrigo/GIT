Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 66104 nanoseconds (6.6104E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 39393 nanoseconds (3.9393E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 26711 nanoseconds (2.6711E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 16992 nanoseconds (1.6992E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 49112 nanoseconds (4.9112E-5 seconds).
