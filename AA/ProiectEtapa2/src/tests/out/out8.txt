Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 67542 nanoseconds (6.7542E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (12) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 0
	match 2 at 11
	match 3 at 24
	match 4 at 36
	match 5 at 50
	match 6 at 61
	match 7 at 74
	match 8 at 86
	match 9 at 100
	match 10 at 111
	match 11 at 124
	match 12 at 136


The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 48938 nanoseconds (4.8938E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 18604 nanoseconds (1.8604E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 71092 nanoseconds (7.1092E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (12) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 0
	match 2 at 11
	match 3 at 24
	match 4 at 36
	match 5 at 50
	match 6 at 61
	match 7 at 74
	match 8 at 86
	match 9 at 100
	match 10 at 111
	match 11 at 124
	match 12 at 136


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Rabin-Karp was faster than Knuth-Morris-Pratt by 3550 nanoseconds (3.55E-6 seconds).
