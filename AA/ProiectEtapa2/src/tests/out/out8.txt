The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 35800 nanoseconds (3.58E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -31783 nanoseconds (-3.1783E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 67583 nanoseconds (6.7583E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
