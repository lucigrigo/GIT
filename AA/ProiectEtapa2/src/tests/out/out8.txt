The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 39604 nanoseconds (3.9604E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -52518 nanoseconds (-5.2518E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 92122 nanoseconds (9.2122E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (12) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 11
	match 3 at index 24
