The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 42737 nanoseconds (4.2737E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 47689 nanoseconds (4.7689E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 90426 nanoseconds (9.0426E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (12) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 11
	match 3 at index 24

	match 12 at index 136

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 28360 nanoseconds (2.836E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (12) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 0
	match 2 at index 11
