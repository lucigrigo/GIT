The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 724826 nanoseconds (7.24826E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -83587 nanoseconds (-8.3587E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 210005 nanoseconds (2.10005E-4 seconds)
