The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 570961 nanoseconds (5.70961E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -105437 nanoseconds (-1.05437E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 676398 nanoseconds (6.76398E-4 seconds)
