The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 594137 nanoseconds (5.94137E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -123289 nanoseconds (-1.23289E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 717426 nanoseconds (7.17426E-4 seconds)
