The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 80910 nanoseconds (8.091E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -5449 nanoseconds (-5.449E-6 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 86359 nanoseconds (8.6359E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
