The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 78473 nanoseconds (7.8473E-5 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 6453 nanoseconds (6.453E-6 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 40821 nanoseconds (4.0821E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
