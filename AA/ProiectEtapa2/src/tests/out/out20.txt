The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 474352 nanoseconds (4.74352E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 451912 nanoseconds (4.51912E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 926264 nanoseconds (9.26264E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 192731 nanoseconds (1.92731E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 733533 nanoseconds (7.33533E-4 seconds).
