The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 1022774 nanoseconds (0.001022774 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -34407 nanoseconds (-3.4407E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 1057181 nanoseconds (0.001057181 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 193889 nanoseconds (1.93889E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 863292 nanoseconds (8.63292E-4 seconds).
