The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 1030194 nanoseconds (0.001030194 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 51645 nanoseconds (5.1645E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 978549 nanoseconds (9.78549E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 199566 nanoseconds (1.99566E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 778983 nanoseconds (7.78983E-4 seconds).
