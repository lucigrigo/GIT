The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 1159802 nanoseconds (0.001159802 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 74340 nanoseconds (7.434E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 1085462 nanoseconds (0.001085462 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 197804 nanoseconds (1.97804E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 887658 nanoseconds (8.87658E-4 seconds).
