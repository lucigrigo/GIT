Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 896579 nanoseconds (8.96579E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 525424 nanoseconds (5.25424E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 371155 nanoseconds (3.71155E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 189092 nanoseconds (1.89092E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
No matches found!


---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 707487 nanoseconds (7.07487E-4 seconds).
