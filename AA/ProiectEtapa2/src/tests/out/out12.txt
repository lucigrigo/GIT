The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 266336 nanoseconds (2.66336E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 12904 nanoseconds (1.2904E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 279240 nanoseconds (2.7924E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (10) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 18
	match 2 at index 146
