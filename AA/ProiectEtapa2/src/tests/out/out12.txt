Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 348415 nanoseconds (3.48415E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (10) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 18
	match 2 at 146
	match 3 at 226
	match 4 at 353
	match 5 at 618
	match 6 at 1146
	match 7 at 2057
	match 8 at 2840
	match 9 at 3151
	match 10 at 3175


The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 310095 nanoseconds (3.10095E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is 38320 nanoseconds (3.832E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt took 79368 nanoseconds (7.9368E-5 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (10) found at index(es):
	match 1 at 18
	match 2 at 146
	match 3 at 226
	match 4 at 353

---------------------------------------
The conclusion of this test is:
Algorithm Knuth-Morris-Pratt was faster than Rabin-Karp by 269047 nanoseconds (2.69047E-4 seconds).
