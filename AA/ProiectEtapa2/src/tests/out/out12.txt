The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 338344 nanoseconds (3.38344E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -319825 nanoseconds (-3.19825E-4 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 658169 nanoseconds (6.58169E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (10) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 18
	match 2 at index 146
