The Rabin-Karp version with a LESS EFFICIENT HASHING FUNCTION
finished the current test in 285111 nanoseconds (2.85111E-4 seconds).
The difference between the efficient version and this one is -79951 nanoseconds (-7.9951E-5 seconds).

Algorithm Rabin-Karp (with an efficient hash function) took 365062 nanoseconds (3.65062E-4 seconds)
to search given pattern in the given text.
Matches (10) found at index(es):
	match 1 at index 18
	match 2 at index 146
